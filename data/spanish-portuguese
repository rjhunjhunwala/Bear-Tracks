<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27f09b3b-ac80-3951-112e-299802d2f866">The sequence of undergraduate programs of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese is designed to lead from the acquisition of competence in written and spoken Spanish or Portuguese, through an acquaintance with the structure and history of one or both of these languages and a critical understanding of the development and achievements of their literatures in the Old World and in the New, to training in advanced study and independent research. The department’s policy is to maintain a balanced strength between language and literature and between Peninsular and Latin American facets of a unified field.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27f09b3b-ac80-3951-112e-299802d2f866">Students in this major choose one of the following concentrations based on general area of interest:</span></p>
<p><strong>Concentration A: The Languages, Literatures, and Cultures of the Spanish-Speaking World</strong></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27f09b3b-ac80-3951-112e-299802d2f866">This concentration is recommended for students interested in the languages, literature, and cultures of the Spanish-speaking World on both sides of the Atlantic.</span></p>
<p><strong>Concentration B: The Languages, Literatures, and Cultures of the Portuguese-Speaking World</strong></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27f09b3b-ac80-3951-112e-299802d2f866">This concentration is recommended for students interested in the language, literature, and culture of the Portuguese-speaking world, and may include up to two upper division electives in Spanish.</span></p>
<p><strong>Concentration C: Latin American Languages, Literatures, and Cultures</strong></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27f09b3b-ac80-3951-112e-299802d2f866">This concentration is recommended for students interested in the languages, literatures, and cultures of both Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking Latin America. It requires coursework in both Spanish and Portuguese, which makes possible comparative approaches to the culture, literature, and history of the region.</span></p>
<p><strong>Concentration D: Hispanic Languages, Linguistics, and Bilingualism</strong></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27f09b3b-ac80-3951-112e-299802d2f866">This concentration is recommended for students interested in the linguistic structure of Spanish and/or Portuguese, bilingualism in society, and/or career in K-12 foreign language teaching, as well as for future graduate students in (Hispanic) Linguistics.</span></p>
<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-27f09b3b-ac80-3951-112e-299802d2f866">Declaring the Major</span></h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27f09b3b-ac80-3951-112e-299802d2f866">Students can receive pre-major advising at any time, from the staff undergraduate advisor. Students can declare the major once they have completed </span><a href="/search/?P=SPANISH%2025">SPANISH 25</a> for concentrations A, C, and D. For concentration B, students must complete  <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PORTUG%2050" title="PORTUG 50" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PORTUG 50');">PORTUG 50</a></span> before declaring the major. These prerequisite courses must be taken for a letter grade.</p>

<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-27f09b3b-ac80-3951-112e-299802d2f866">Honors Program</span></h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27f09b3b-ac80-3951-112e-299802d2f866">Students are eligible to do honors work within the Department of Spanish and Portuguese if they have completed at least two semesters of work at Berkeley with an overall grade point average of 3.3 and a grade point average of at least 3.6 in those courses taken within the major. Students must complete two honors courses, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SPANISH%20H195A" title="SPANISH H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SPANISH H195A');">SPANISH H195A</a></span> (1.5 units) and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SPANISH%20H195B" title="SPANISH H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SPANISH H195B');">SPANISH H195B</a></span> (1.5 units), in two successive semesters, and will write a thesis under the supervision of an appropriate departmental faculty member over the course of two successive semesters. A letter grade, reflecting progress, will be given after the first semester. H195A/B will not count toward the required upper division work in the major. Before the semester in which students intend to begin the honors program, they should speak with the staff undergraduate advisor to verify eligibility for honors work and to discuss the process.</span>

Taught in Spanish, Span 101 serves as an introduction to the Spanish sound system through an exploration of the complexities of native-like Spanish pronunciation and perceptions of native and non-native accent. Designed for both native and non-native speakers of Spanish as well as students without formal coursework in (Hispanic) Linguistics, this course centers on the acoustic nuances that distinguish standard Spanish</span><span class="deschide"> pronunciation from non-standard and non-native pronunciations. Emphasis will be placed on comparisons between the Spanish and English sound systems, and the acquisition of a native-like accent will be addressed from both theoretical and practical standpoints.</span><br/>

In this course we will discuss the essential rules for a good essay. We will study strategies for academic essays, concentrating our efforts on the thesis-driven argumentative literary essay. We will apply the rules of literary analysis in such a way as to convince the reader that we are presenting an interpretation of the deep content. Towards this end we will read some short but complex works,</span><span class="deschide"> generally shifting the balance from reading so as to create more opportunities for individual analysis and writing. We will also be growing vocabulary, improving spelling and reviewing certain complex grammatical structures.</span><br/>

Conversion often refers to changing religions. This process can be personal or historical, involve a single individual or entire groups, such as at the moment of colonization of the Americas, when thousands of indigenous people were forcibly or willingly converted to Christianity. But what does it mean to convert? Is it a one-time event by which change gets effected and is final, or, does it involve multiple negotiations?</span><span class="deschide"> Does the converter become curious about and affected by the beliefs of those he tries to gain over to his religion? What implications does this have for art, technology, thought? We will look at how this concept gets represented in different media and divergent forms of literacy: textual, pictorial, ritual.</span><br/>

This course offers a panoramic view of Brazilian culture and history through lyric traditions and counter-traditions. Our focus will be Brazilian poems (including song lyrics) from the 19th century to the present, but we will also examine colonial and baroque texts and how they resonate with modern, mid-century and post-dictatorship literary materials. Moving through key poetic movements from simbolismo to Poesia Marginal</span><span class="deschide">, we will examine why the lyric has been a chosen medium for authors to conceptualize identity, difference, ethics, politics and aesthetics.

The course will focus on a selection of some of the most celebrated Spanish lyric poetry from the Middle Ages through the early 20th century. This will include reflection on the idea of lyric and lyric subjectivity, the continuities and discontinuities that have characterized lyric poetry over time, and exploration of some of the more striking features of lyric poetry in comparison to other forms</span><span class="deschide"> of discourse. Our primary focus will be on techniques of reading, methods of analysis and the particularities of the poems we read. Extensive prior experience reading poetry is not required; a passion for protracted attention to the language of poetry is.</span><br/>

This course will be devoted to reading and analysis of modern and contemporary fiction by Spanish-American authors. We will approach these works as windows onto the past and present of the region and discuss themes of memory, human rights, identity, globalization and political change. The course will explore the diverse practices of reading and critical analysis that these literary works demand. Secondary readings will</span><span class="deschide"> provide historical and political context and will also help us hone in on a key question that has been central to the tradition of Spanish-American literary critique: how do fictional texts dialogue with other kinds of texts, literary and non-literary?</span><br/>
