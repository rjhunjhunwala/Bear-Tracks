				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">As interactions between states, societies, and cultures increase, so do the responses to these interactions multiply. The Global Studies major allows students to explore such interactions and their outcomes. By bringing in both historical and contemporary material, the major provides students with the tools that they need in order to make sense of the world in which they live—as well as understanding how it got to be that way. Students pursuing an undergraduate degree in global studies will engage in thinking critically about how global change has (and can) come about during their lifetimes. The major aims to have students focus on relevant issues to them in a way that provides intellectual flexibility. The major will offer solid training in how to use acquired knowledge to become agents of positive change on the global issues that matter most to people here, and elsewhere around the world. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Global Studies Major</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Global Studies major requires students to choose a concentration and a geographic region in which to become an expert. It connects this regional specialization to language training. Global Studies majors will choose one of three concentrations: (1) Global Development, (2) Global Peace and Conflict, or (3) Global Societies and Cultures. This will allow students to focus their studies on a specific aspect of the “global.” At the same time, those pursuing this major will choose one of five regions (Asia, Africa, Europe/Russia, The Americas or the Middle East) in which to specialize, both in terms of content and language. In doing so, students have an opportunity to become an expert in a specific region, especially as it relates to larger questions that arise from global interaction. In addition, the major requires training in critical thinking—that is how to study a particular problem in a consistent and rigorous way. Students will work with faculty and the Global Studies advisors to devise a program that best captures their interests and allows them to reach their intellectual and professional potentials.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Global Studies Minor</h3>
<p>The minor in Global Studies provides an opportunity to study one of five regions of the world within the context of Globalization: (1) Europe and Russia; (2) Africa, North and Sub-Saharan; (3) The Americas; (4) The Middle East and North Africa; (5) Asia.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://globalstudies.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Foreign Language Requirement</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Global Studies majors must demonstrate proficiency in a modern language other than English by the last semester of their senior year. This language must be connected, in either the past or the present, to the student’s geographic region of specialization. Proficiency is equivalent to the ability achieved in four college-level semesters (or two years). Language courses taken in high school do not satisfy this requirement. See below for details on how to fulfill the foreign language requirement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Note:  languages accepted by the College of Letters &amp; Science are not automatically accepted by the Global Studies major. Please check with an adviser for eligible languages.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to fulfill the foreign language requirement</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a variety of ways to fulfill the four-semester language requirement for Global Studies, depending on the individual and his or her background and ability. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) test: </strong>An AP score of 5 or an International Baccalaureate (IB) score of 7 will complete this requirement. An AP score of 4 should generally place a student into the fourth-semester college-level course. A score of 3 will place a student into the third-semester college-level course. Documentation of AP scores must be provided. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Coursework:</strong>  Any combination of college courses, summer programs, or college-level study abroad programs can satisfy the language requirement. At a minimum, students must complete the fourth semester (i.e., the second semester of intermediate level) of a language with a grade of C- or better in order to fulfill the requirement. The first, second, and third-semester courses may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Language courses need not be taken at UCB. Courses taken at a community college or any accredited school or university may be acceptable. Transcripts must be submitted and evaluated by an adviser. A one-semester upper division course taken abroad in the target language may satisfy the foreign language requirement, depending on the school and program followed. For more information, see an adviser concerning language study abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>High school completion in a non-English language and Proficiency Tests:</strong>  Students with native, advanced background or those who were educated in a non-English language through the completion of high school or the equivalent may wish to satisfy this requirement with that experience. This requires a language proficiency exam. Moreover, it limits the geographic focus within global studies, because it must be connected to language. This is not especially recommended, as it limits what students within the major can study. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chinese, Japanese, and Korean proficiency exams are administered by East Asian Languages and Cultures (EALC) on the Tuesday before instruction starts every semester. Check the EALC website at <a href="http://ealc.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/proficiency-exams" target="_blank">http://ealc.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/proficiency-exams</a>. Results of the exam will indicate the level of the foreign language that students are eligible to register for. In order to waive the language requirement, test results must show that the student has completed the equivalent of four semesters of language studies (end of intermediate level) or higher.   </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Note: EALC waitlists all students that register for language courses regardless of when registration takes place, and the department scheduler adjusts student enrollment based on the results of the placement exam during the first week of instruction.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students planning to take a proficiency exam in a non-Asian language in order to waive the language requirement should consult with an IAS adviser. Proficiency tests may be taken once per semester.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Upper Division Requirements</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eight courses divided into two categories: All courses must be taken for a letter grade. </span>It is worth noting here, as elsewhere, that the student’s language training should match up with the particular world region on which the student has decided to focus. </p>

This course offers an introduction to ways of thinking about, and visualizing, “the global” over time. People from different societies and cultures have been drawn together as a result of processes that can best be conceived of as “flows” of people, capital, ideas and goods. Using a panoramic lens, we will explore a series of interactions, analyzing the wide-ranging effects of those interactions and</span><span class="deschide"> the artifacts they produced. By studying a variety of encounters, we will cultivate a broader sense of how the “global” has been defined and experienced through the lens of cultural interaction. Globalization itself is not a new phenomenon; it can be traced back centuries if not millennia.</span><br/>

Topics will include but are not limited to: human rights diplomacy; the influence of human rights in international legal</span><span class="deschide"> practice; cultural and minority rights; genocide and the world community; cultural relativism and national sovereignty; international law and international relations; individual and collective rights; migration, labor, and globalization; and national, international, and nongovernmental organizations.</span><br/>

This course will describe the issues, policies and practices of counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency. Terrorism continues to increase in frequency and lethality. Insurgency too is more frequent and deadly (insurgency now is riskier than terrorism). The actors and methods increasingly overlap, so that terrorism and insurgency practically must be studied together. This course examines the concepts, history, motivations and methods of terrorism and insurgency, and</span><span class="deschide"> ways in which the counter-terrorist and counter-insurgent side counter those motivations and methods, navigating the legal and ethical bounds.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">As interactions between states, societies, and cultures increase, so do the responses to these interactions multiply. The Global Studies major allows students to explore such interactions and their outcomes. By bringing in both historical and contemporary material, the major provides students with the tools that they need in order to make sense of the world in which they live—as well as understanding how it got to be that way. Students pursuing an undergraduate degree in global studies will engage in thinking critically about how global change has (and can) come about during their lifetimes. The major aims to have students focus on relevant issues to them in a way that provides intellectual flexibility. The major will offer solid training in how to use acquired knowledge to become agents of positive change on the global issues that matter most to people here, and elsewhere around the world. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Global Studies Major</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Global Studies major requires students to choose a concentration and a geographic region in which to become an expert. It connects this regional specialization to language training. Global Studies majors will choose one of three concentrations: (1) Global Development, (2) Global Peace and Conflict, or (3) Global Societies and Cultures. This will allow students to focus their studies on a specific aspect of the “global.” At the same time, those pursuing this major will choose one of five regions (Asia, Africa, Europe/Russia, The Americas or the Middle East) in which to specialize, both in terms of content and language. In doing so, students have an opportunity to become an expert in a specific region, especially as it relates to larger questions that arise from global interaction. In addition, the major requires training in critical thinking—that is how to study a particular problem in a consistent and rigorous way. Students will work with faculty and the Global Studies advisors to devise a program that best captures their interests and allows them to reach their intellectual and professional potentials.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Global Studies Minor</h3>
<p>The minor in Global Studies provides an opportunity to study one of five regions of the world within the context of Globalization: (1) Europe and Russia; (2) Africa, North and Sub-Saharan; (3) The Americas; (4) The Middle East and North Africa; (5) Asia.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://globalstudies.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Foreign Language Requirement</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Global Studies majors must demonstrate proficiency in a modern language other than English by the last semester of their senior year. This language must be connected, in either the past or the present, to the student’s geographic region of specialization. Proficiency is equivalent to the ability achieved in four college-level semesters (or two years). Language courses taken in high school do not satisfy this requirement. See below for details on how to fulfill the foreign language requirement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Note:  languages accepted by the College of Letters &amp; Science are not automatically accepted by the Global Studies major. Please check with an adviser for eligible languages.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to fulfill the foreign language requirement</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a variety of ways to fulfill the four-semester language requirement for Global Studies, depending on the individual and his or her background and ability. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) test: </strong>An AP score of 5 or an International Baccalaureate (IB) score of 7 will complete this requirement. An AP score of 4 should generally place a student into the fourth-semester college-level course. A score of 3 will place a student into the third-semester college-level course. Documentation of AP scores must be provided. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Coursework:</strong>  Any combination of college courses, summer programs, or college-level study abroad programs can satisfy the language requirement. At a minimum, students must complete the fourth semester (i.e., the second semester of intermediate level) of a language with a grade of C- or better in order to fulfill the requirement. The first, second, and third-semester courses may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Language courses need not be taken at UCB. Courses taken at a community college or any accredited school or university may be acceptable. Transcripts must be submitted and evaluated by an adviser. A one-semester upper division course taken abroad in the target language may satisfy the foreign language requirement, depending on the school and program followed. For more information, see an adviser concerning language study abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>High school completion in a non-English language and Proficiency Tests:</strong>  Students with native, advanced background or those who were educated in a non-English language through the completion of high school or the equivalent may wish to satisfy this requirement with that experience. This requires a language proficiency exam. Moreover, it limits the geographic focus within global studies, because it must be connected to language. This is not especially recommended, as it limits what students within the major can study. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chinese, Japanese, and Korean proficiency exams are administered by East Asian Languages and Cultures (EALC) on the Tuesday before instruction starts every semester. Check the EALC website at <a href="http://ealc.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/proficiency-exams" target="_blank">http://ealc.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/proficiency-exams</a>. Results of the exam will indicate the level of the foreign language that students are eligible to register for. In order to waive the language requirement, test results must show that the student has completed the equivalent of four semesters of language studies (end of intermediate level) or higher.   </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Note: EALC waitlists all students that register for language courses regardless of when registration takes place, and the department scheduler adjusts student enrollment based on the results of the placement exam during the first week of instruction.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students planning to take a proficiency exam in a non-Asian language in order to waive the language requirement should consult with an IAS adviser. Proficiency tests may be taken once per semester.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Upper Division Requirements</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eight courses divided into two categories: All courses must be taken for a letter grade. </span>It is worth noting here, as elsewhere, that the student’s language training should match up with the particular world region on which the student has decided to focus. </p>

This course focuses on the history of global interaction, with a particular emphasis on the relationships between states and societies. Though it begins with a brief exploration of antiquity, it emphasizes world developments since the 15th century. The purpose of the course is to gain a better understanding of the rise and decline of states, empires, and international trading systems. Taking a panoramic view of the last 500 years, it explores the ways in</span><span class="deschide"> which disparate places came closer together, even while it seeks to explain how those places maintained their own trajectories in the face of outside intervention.</span><br/>

This course offers an introduction to ways of thinking about, and visualizing, “the global” over time. People from different societies and cultures have been drawn together as a result of processes that can best be conceived of as “flows” of people, capital, ideas and goods. Using a panoramic lens, we will explore a series of interactions, analyzing the wide-ranging effects of those interactions and</span><span class="deschide"> the artifacts they produced. By studying a variety of encounters, we will cultivate a broader sense of how the “global” has been defined and experienced through the lens of cultural interaction. Globalization itself is not a new phenomenon; it can be traced back centuries if not millennia.</span><br/>

This course will study a wide spectrum of opinions and views on the issue of “comfort women.” Students will approach this topic in the context of wartime sexual and gender-based violence at a time when an imperial order was the norm. Students will also probe shifting narratives of wartime responsibilities in the post-war Japanese and Korean societies. Students will engage in issues of reparations, legal accountability, historical memories, truth</span><span class="deschide"> and justice, apology and forgiveness, and reconciliation both at the personal and structural levels, by directly interacting with the conflict parties who represent such diverse positions. This is a summer study abroad course in Tokyo and Seoul.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">As interactions between states, societies, and cultures increase, so do the responses to these interactions multiply. The Global Studies major allows students to explore such interactions and their outcomes. By bringing in both historical and contemporary material, the major provides students with the tools that they need in order to make sense of the world in which they live—as well as understanding how it got to be that way. Students pursuing an undergraduate degree in global studies will engage in thinking critically about how global change has (and can) come about during their lifetimes. The major aims to have students focus on relevant issues to them in a way that provides intellectual flexibility. The major will offer solid training in how to use acquired knowledge to become agents of positive change on the global issues that matter most to people here, and elsewhere around the world. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Global Studies Major</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Global Studies major requires students to choose a concentration and a geographic region in which to become an expert. It connects this regional specialization to language training. Global Studies majors will choose one of three concentrations: (1) Global Development, (2) Global Peace and Conflict, or (3) Global Societies and Cultures. This will allow students to focus their studies on a specific aspect of the “global.” At the same time, those pursuing this major will choose one of five regions (Asia, Africa, Europe/Russia, The Americas or the Middle East) in which to specialize, both in terms of content and language. In doing so, students have an opportunity to become an expert in a specific region, especially as it relates to larger questions that arise from global interaction. In addition, the major requires training in critical thinking—that is how to study a particular problem in a consistent and rigorous way. Students will work with faculty and the Global Studies advisors to devise a program that best captures their interests and allows them to reach their intellectual and professional potentials.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Global Studies Minor</h3>
<p>The minor in Global Studies provides an opportunity to study one of five regions of the world within the context of Globalization: (1) Europe and Russia; (2) Africa, North and Sub-Saharan; (3) The Americas; (4) The Middle East and North Africa; (5) Asia.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://globalstudies.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Foreign Language Requirement</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Global Studies majors must demonstrate proficiency in a modern language other than English by the last semester of their senior year. This language must be connected, in either the past or the present, to the student’s geographic region of specialization. Proficiency is equivalent to the ability achieved in four college-level semesters (or two years). Language courses taken in high school do not satisfy this requirement. See below for details on how to fulfill the foreign language requirement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Note:  languages accepted by the College of Letters &amp; Science are not automatically accepted by the Global Studies major. Please check with an adviser for eligible languages.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to fulfill the foreign language requirement</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a variety of ways to fulfill the four-semester language requirement for Global Studies, depending on the individual and his or her background and ability. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) test: </strong>An AP score of 5 or an International Baccalaureate (IB) score of 7 will complete this requirement. An AP score of 4 should generally place a student into the fourth-semester college-level course. A score of 3 will place a student into the third-semester college-level course. Documentation of AP scores must be provided. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Coursework:</strong>  Any combination of college courses, summer programs, or college-level study abroad programs can satisfy the language requirement. At a minimum, students must complete the fourth semester (i.e., the second semester of intermediate level) of a language with a grade of C- or better in order to fulfill the requirement. The first, second, and third-semester courses may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Language courses need not be taken at UCB. Courses taken at a community college or any accredited school or university may be acceptable. Transcripts must be submitted and evaluated by an adviser. A one-semester upper division course taken abroad in the target language may satisfy the foreign language requirement, depending on the school and program followed. For more information, see an adviser concerning language study abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>High school completion in a non-English language and Proficiency Tests:</strong>  Students with native, advanced background or those who were educated in a non-English language through the completion of high school or the equivalent may wish to satisfy this requirement with that experience. This requires a language proficiency exam. Moreover, it limits the geographic focus within global studies, because it must be connected to language. This is not especially recommended, as it limits what students within the major can study. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chinese, Japanese, and Korean proficiency exams are administered by East Asian Languages and Cultures (EALC) on the Tuesday before instruction starts every semester. Check the EALC website at <a href="http://ealc.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/proficiency-exams" target="_blank">http://ealc.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/proficiency-exams</a>. Results of the exam will indicate the level of the foreign language that students are eligible to register for. In order to waive the language requirement, test results must show that the student has completed the equivalent of four semesters of language studies (end of intermediate level) or higher.   </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Note: EALC waitlists all students that register for language courses regardless of when registration takes place, and the department scheduler adjusts student enrollment based on the results of the placement exam during the first week of instruction.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students planning to take a proficiency exam in a non-Asian language in order to waive the language requirement should consult with an IAS adviser. Proficiency tests may be taken once per semester.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Upper Division Requirements</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eight courses divided into two categories: All courses must be taken for a letter grade. </span>It is worth noting here, as elsewhere, that the student’s language training should match up with the particular world region on which the student has decided to focus. </p>

This course offers an introduction to ways of thinking about, and visualizing, “the global” over time. People from different societies and cultures have been drawn together as a result of processes that can best be conceived of as “flows” of people, capital, ideas and goods. Using a panoramic lens, we will explore a series of interactions, analyzing the wide-ranging effects of those interactions and</span><span class="deschide"> the artifacts they produced. By studying a variety of encounters, we will cultivate a broader sense of how the “global” has been defined and experienced through the lens of cultural interaction. Globalization itself is not a new phenomenon; it can be traced back centuries if not millennia.</span><br/>

Topics will include but are not limited to: human rights diplomacy; the influence of human rights in international legal</span><span class="deschide"> practice; cultural and minority rights; genocide and the world community; cultural relativism and national sovereignty; international law and international relations; individual and collective rights; migration, labor, and globalization; and national, international, and nongovernmental organizations.</span><br/>

This course will describe the issues, policies and practices of counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency. Terrorism continues to increase in frequency and lethality. Insurgency too is more frequent and deadly (insurgency now is riskier than terrorism). The actors and methods increasingly overlap, so that terrorism and insurgency practically must be studied together. This course examines the concepts, history, motivations and methods of terrorism and insurgency, and</span><span class="deschide"> ways in which the counter-terrorist and counter-insurgent side counter those motivations and methods, navigating the legal and ethical bounds.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">As interactions between states, societies, and cultures increase, so do the responses to these interactions multiply. The Global Studies major allows students to explore such interactions and their outcomes. By bringing in both historical and contemporary material, the major provides students with the tools that they need in order to make sense of the world in which they live—as well as understanding how it got to be that way. Students pursuing an undergraduate degree in global studies will engage in thinking critically about how global change has (and can) come about during their lifetimes. The major aims to have students focus on relevant issues to them in a way that provides intellectual flexibility. The major will offer solid training in how to use acquired knowledge to become agents of positive change on the global issues that matter most to people here, and elsewhere around the world. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Global Studies Major</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Global Studies major requires students to choose a concentration and a geographic region in which to become an expert. It connects this regional specialization to language training. Global Studies majors will choose one of three concentrations: (1) Global Development, (2) Global Peace and Conflict, or (3) Global Societies and Cultures. This will allow students to focus their studies on a specific aspect of the “global.” At the same time, those pursuing this major will choose one of five regions (Asia, Africa, Europe/Russia, The Americas or the Middle East) in which to specialize, both in terms of content and language. In doing so, students have an opportunity to become an expert in a specific region, especially as it relates to larger questions that arise from global interaction. In addition, the major requires training in critical thinking—that is how to study a particular problem in a consistent and rigorous way. Students will work with faculty and the Global Studies advisors to devise a program that best captures their interests and allows them to reach their intellectual and professional potentials.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Global Studies Minor</h3>
<p>The minor in Global Studies provides an opportunity to study one of five regions of the world within the context of Globalization: (1) Europe and Russia; (2) Africa, North and Sub-Saharan; (3) The Americas; (4) The Middle East and North Africa; (5) Asia.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://globalstudies.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Foreign Language Requirement</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Global Studies majors must demonstrate proficiency in a modern language other than English by the last semester of their senior year. This language must be connected, in either the past or the present, to the student’s geographic region of specialization. Proficiency is equivalent to the ability achieved in four college-level semesters (or two years). Language courses taken in high school do not satisfy this requirement. See below for details on how to fulfill the foreign language requirement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Note:  languages accepted by the College of Letters &amp; Science are not automatically accepted by the Global Studies major. Please check with an adviser for eligible languages.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to fulfill the foreign language requirement</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a variety of ways to fulfill the four-semester language requirement for Global Studies, depending on the individual and his or her background and ability. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) test: </strong>An AP score of 5 or an International Baccalaureate (IB) score of 7 will complete this requirement. An AP score of 4 should generally place a student into the fourth-semester college-level course. A score of 3 will place a student into the third-semester college-level course. Documentation of AP scores must be provided. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Coursework:</strong>  Any combination of college courses, summer programs, or college-level study abroad programs can satisfy the language requirement. At a minimum, students must complete the fourth semester (i.e., the second semester of intermediate level) of a language with a grade of C- or better in order to fulfill the requirement. The first, second, and third-semester courses may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Language courses need not be taken at UCB. Courses taken at a community college or any accredited school or university may be acceptable. Transcripts must be submitted and evaluated by an adviser. A one-semester upper division course taken abroad in the target language may satisfy the foreign language requirement, depending on the school and program followed. For more information, see an adviser concerning language study abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>High school completion in a non-English language and Proficiency Tests:</strong>  Students with native, advanced background or those who were educated in a non-English language through the completion of high school or the equivalent may wish to satisfy this requirement with that experience. This requires a language proficiency exam. Moreover, it limits the geographic focus within global studies, because it must be connected to language. This is not especially recommended, as it limits what students within the major can study. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chinese, Japanese, and Korean proficiency exams are administered by East Asian Languages and Cultures (EALC) on the Tuesday before instruction starts every semester. Check the EALC website at <a href="http://ealc.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/proficiency-exams" target="_blank">http://ealc.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/proficiency-exams</a>. Results of the exam will indicate the level of the foreign language that students are eligible to register for. In order to waive the language requirement, test results must show that the student has completed the equivalent of four semesters of language studies (end of intermediate level) or higher.   </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Note: EALC waitlists all students that register for language courses regardless of when registration takes place, and the department scheduler adjusts student enrollment based on the results of the placement exam during the first week of instruction.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students planning to take a proficiency exam in a non-Asian language in order to waive the language requirement should consult with an IAS adviser. Proficiency tests may be taken once per semester.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Upper Division Requirements</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eight courses divided into two categories: All courses must be taken for a letter grade. </span>It is worth noting here, as elsewhere, that the student’s language training should match up with the particular world region on which the student has decided to focus. </p>

This course focuses on the history of global interaction, with a particular emphasis on the relationships between states and societies. Though it begins with a brief exploration of antiquity, it emphasizes world developments since the 15th century. The purpose of the course is to gain a better understanding of the rise and decline of states, empires, and international trading systems. Taking a panoramic view of the last 500 years, it explores the ways in</span><span class="deschide"> which disparate places came closer together, even while it seeks to explain how those places maintained their own trajectories in the face of outside intervention.</span><br/>

This course offers an introduction to ways of thinking about, and visualizing, “the global” over time. People from different societies and cultures have been drawn together as a result of processes that can best be conceived of as “flows” of people, capital, ideas and goods. Using a panoramic lens, we will explore a series of interactions, analyzing the wide-ranging effects of those interactions and</span><span class="deschide"> the artifacts they produced. By studying a variety of encounters, we will cultivate a broader sense of how the “global” has been defined and experienced through the lens of cultural interaction. Globalization itself is not a new phenomenon; it can be traced back centuries if not millennia.</span><br/>

This course will study a wide spectrum of opinions and views on the issue of “comfort women.” Students will approach this topic in the context of wartime sexual and gender-based violence at a time when an imperial order was the norm. Students will also probe shifting narratives of wartime responsibilities in the post-war Japanese and Korean societies. Students will engage in issues of reparations, legal accountability, historical memories, truth</span><span class="deschide"> and justice, apology and forgiveness, and reconciliation both at the personal and structural levels, by directly interacting with the conflict parties who represent such diverse positions. This is a summer study abroad course in Tokyo and Seoul.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p class="p1"><span class="s1">As interactions between states, societies, and cultures increase, so do the responses to these interactions multiply. The Global Studies major allows students to explore such interactions and their outcomes. By bringing in both historical and contemporary material, the major provides students with the tools that they need in order to make sense of the world in which they live—as well as understanding how it got to be that way. Students pursuing an undergraduate degree in global studies will engage in thinking critically about how global change has (and can) come about during their lifetimes. The major aims to have students focus on relevant issues to them in a way that provides intellectual flexibility. The major will offer solid training in how to use acquired knowledge to become agents of positive change on the global issues that matter most to people here, and elsewhere around the world. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Global Studies Major</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Global Studies major requires students to choose a concentration and a geographic region in which to become an expert. It connects this regional specialization to language training. Global Studies majors will choose one of three concentrations: (1) Global Development, (2) Global Peace and Conflict, or (3) Global Societies and Cultures. This will allow students to focus their studies on a specific aspect of the “global.” At the same time, those pursuing this major will choose one of five regions (Asia, Africa, Europe/Russia, The Americas or the Middle East) in which to specialize, both in terms of content and language. In doing so, students have an opportunity to become an expert in a specific region, especially as it relates to larger questions that arise from global interaction. In addition, the major requires training in critical thinking—that is how to study a particular problem in a consistent and rigorous way. Students will work with faculty and the Global Studies advisors to devise a program that best captures their interests and allows them to reach their intellectual and professional potentials.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Global Studies Minor</h3>
<p>The minor in Global Studies provides an opportunity to study one of five regions of the world within the context of Globalization: (1) Europe and Russia; (2) Africa, North and Sub-Saharan; (3) The Americas; (4) The Middle East and North Africa; (5) Asia.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://globalstudies.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Foreign Language Requirement</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Global Studies majors must demonstrate proficiency in a modern language other than English by the last semester of their senior year. This language must be connected, in either the past or the present, to the student’s geographic region of specialization. Proficiency is equivalent to the ability achieved in four college-level semesters (or two years). Language courses taken in high school do not satisfy this requirement. See below for details on how to fulfill the foreign language requirement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Note:  languages accepted by the College of Letters &amp; Science are not automatically accepted by the Global Studies major. Please check with an adviser for eligible languages.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to fulfill the foreign language requirement</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a variety of ways to fulfill the four-semester language requirement for Global Studies, depending on the individual and his or her background and ability. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) test: </strong>An AP score of 5 or an International Baccalaureate (IB) score of 7 will complete this requirement. An AP score of 4 should generally place a student into the fourth-semester college-level course. A score of 3 will place a student into the third-semester college-level course. Documentation of AP scores must be provided. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Coursework:</strong>  Any combination of college courses, summer programs, or college-level study abroad programs can satisfy the language requirement. At a minimum, students must complete the fourth semester (i.e., the second semester of intermediate level) of a language with a grade of C- or better in order to fulfill the requirement. The first, second, and third-semester courses may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Language courses need not be taken at UCB. Courses taken at a community college or any accredited school or university may be acceptable. Transcripts must be submitted and evaluated by an adviser. A one-semester upper division course taken abroad in the target language may satisfy the foreign language requirement, depending on the school and program followed. For more information, see an adviser concerning language study abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>High school completion in a non-English language and Proficiency Tests:</strong>  Students with native, advanced background or those who were educated in a non-English language through the completion of high school or the equivalent may wish to satisfy this requirement with that experience. This requires a language proficiency exam. Moreover, it limits the geographic focus within global studies, because it must be connected to language. This is not especially recommended, as it limits what students within the major can study. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chinese, Japanese, and Korean proficiency exams are administered by East Asian Languages and Cultures (EALC) on the Tuesday before instruction starts every semester. Check the EALC website at <a href="http://ealc.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/proficiency-exams" target="_blank">http://ealc.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/proficiency-exams</a>. Results of the exam will indicate the level of the foreign language that students are eligible to register for. In order to waive the language requirement, test results must show that the student has completed the equivalent of four semesters of language studies (end of intermediate level) or higher.   </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Note: EALC waitlists all students that register for language courses regardless of when registration takes place, and the department scheduler adjusts student enrollment based on the results of the placement exam during the first week of instruction.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students planning to take a proficiency exam in a non-Asian language in order to waive the language requirement should consult with an IAS adviser. Proficiency tests may be taken once per semester.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Upper Division Requirements</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eight courses divided into two categories: All courses must be taken for a letter grade. </span>It is worth noting here, as elsewhere, that the student’s language training should match up with the particular world region on which the student has decided to focus. </p>

This course offers an introduction to ways of thinking about, and visualizing, “the global” over time. People from different societies and cultures have been drawn together as a result of processes that can best be conceived of as “flows” of people, capital, ideas and goods. Using a panoramic lens, we will explore a series of interactions, analyzing the wide-ranging effects of those interactions and</span><span class="deschide"> the artifacts they produced. By studying a variety of encounters, we will cultivate a broader sense of how the “global” has been defined and experienced through the lens of cultural interaction. Globalization itself is not a new phenomenon; it can be traced back centuries if not millennia.</span><br/>

Topics will include but are not limited to: human rights diplomacy; the influence of human rights in international legal</span><span class="deschide"> practice; cultural and minority rights; genocide and the world community; cultural relativism and national sovereignty; international law and international relations; individual and collective rights; migration, labor, and globalization; and national, international, and nongovernmental organizations.</span><br/>

This course will describe the issues, policies and practices of counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency. Terrorism continues to increase in frequency and lethality. Insurgency too is more frequent and deadly (insurgency now is riskier than terrorism). The actors and methods increasingly overlap, so that terrorism and insurgency practically must be studied together. This course examines the concepts, history, motivations and methods of terrorism and insurgency, and</span><span class="deschide"> ways in which the counter-terrorist and counter-insurgent side counter those motivations and methods, navigating the legal and ethical bounds.</span><br/>
