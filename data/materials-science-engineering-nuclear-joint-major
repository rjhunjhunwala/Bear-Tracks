				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. These curricula include the core courses in each of the major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. Both majors are shown on the student's transcript of record.</p>
<p>The interface between materials science and engineering and nuclear engineering is an especially challenging and rewarding one giving students in this joint major an exciting range of career options. With a sound curriculum steeped in the fundamentals, the joint major program prepares students to fully understand the behavior of materials in a reactor or related extreme environments, including their design and optimization. Students completing this joint major will successfully compete for positions in the energy sector.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Joint Major</h3>
<p>Admission directly to a joint major is closed to freshmen and junior transfer applicants. Students interested in a joint program may apply to change majors during specific times in their academic progress. Please see the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors">College of Engineering joint majors website</a> for complete details.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All technical courses taken in satisfaction of major requirements must be taken for a letter grade.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for all work undertaken at UC Berkeley.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum GPA of 2.0 is required for all technical courses taken in satisfaction of major requirements.</p>

This requirement, built into all the engineering programs of study, includes two reading and composition courses (R&amp;C), and four additional courses within which a number of specific conditions must be satisfied. Follow these guidelines to fulfill this requirement:</p> <ol> 	<li>Complete a minimum of six courses from the  approved <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/hssreq" target="_blank">Humanities/Social Sciences (H/SS) lists</a>. </li> 	<li>Courses must be a minimum of 3 semester units (or 4 quarter units).</li> 	<li>Two of the six courses must fulfill the College's Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) requirement.

You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement.

This course is intended to give students the opportunity to expand their knowledge of topics related to biomedical materials selection and design. Structure-property relationships of biomedical materials and their interaction with biological systems will be addressed. Applications of the concepts developed include blood-materials compatibility, biomimetic materials, hard and soft tissue-materials interactions, drug delivery, tissue engineering</span><span class="deschide">, and biotechnology.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> <br/>
Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
<br/>
•<br/>
Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
•<br/>
Understanding of the origin of surface forces and interfacial free energy, and how they contribute to the development of the biomaterial interface and ultimately biomaterial performance.<br/></p></div>
