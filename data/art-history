				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>History of Art Major Program</h3>
<p>The Major in History of Art is designed to give students solid grounding in the artistic traditions, practices, and contexts that comprise historical and contemporary visuality. Equally, it introduces the discipline’s history, methods, and debates. It prepares students to do independent research, to evaluate evidence, to create coherent and sustained arguments, and to develop skills in academic writing. In a series of increasingly focused courses — lower division, upper division, seminar, and honors program — the major provides a format for students to learn how to analyze and interpret visual, material, and textual evidence from specific cultural settings and historical circumstances. Major requirements are also designed to maximize exposure to different historical periods, geographical regions, and topics while allowing flexibility for students to pursue specific interests by selecting a Focus of Study.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>To declare the major in the History of Art Department, a student must complete two courses taught in the department and receive a grade of C- or higher in each course. All subsequent courses a student wishes to apply to the major must also receive a grade of C- or higher. Once these prerequisites are met, students may formally petition to declare the major by making an appointment with an Undergraduate Adviser at any time during the fall and spring semesters. (Students in residence at UC Berkeley are strongly urged to complete all lower division requirements and one upper division course by the end of their sophomore year.) <strong>Transfer students should plan to take two History of Art courses in their first semester.</strong></p>
<p>Majors who declare early, especially in the sophomore year, enjoy several advantages:</p>
<p><span>1. A more thorough preparation for seminars and time to study more closely with several members of the faculty.</span></p>
<p>2. Greater flexibility in coordinating major requirements with College of Letters &amp; Science (L&amp;S) requirements and in planning a sequence of courses that allows for special courses or programs of study, e.g., study abroad, curatorial internships, independent study, a double-major, and the honors program.</p>
<p>3. Time for a generally higher level of study in the senior year, and opportunity to experiment with and prepare for diverse career opportunities.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with at least a 3.7 grade point average (GPA) in the History of Art major are eligible for admission into the honors program. Candidates for honors in History of Art are required to complete satisfactorily, within their senior year, an honors thesis consisting of at least two semesters of continuing academic work under faculty supervision (usually a seminar, directed research, or independent study course in the first semester plus, in the second semester, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20H195" title="HISTART H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART H195');">HISTART H195</a></span>). Those who have completed the program will graduate with honors, high honors, or highest honors in the major depending upon their final GPA in all upper division courses taken to fulfill the major requirements. Please see the department's <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-major-requirements/honors-thesis/">honors program webpage</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The minor program in the History of Art Department is designed to provide a structured and broad program for those students majoring in other disciplines but with a strong interest in the history of art. For information regarding declaring the minor, please contact the department.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p><span>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</span></p>
<h3>The History of Art Major Program (41-52 units)</h3>
<h4>I. Lower Division Requirements (4 courses)</h4>
<h5>A. Three History of Art Courses (9-12 units)</h5>
<p>Majors must complete 9 to 12 units of lower division course work in the History of Art Department. These units may come from courses taken in the department, courses taken at other institutions granted transfer credit for the major by the department, or from AP Art History (score of 4 or 5). Courses that qualify for lower division requirements include:</p>
<p>4 unit lecture courses: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2010" title="HISTART 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 10');">HISTART 10</a></span> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2011" title="HISTART 11" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 11');">HISTART 11</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2034" title="HISTART 34" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 34');">HISTART 34</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2035" title="HISTART 35" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 35');">HISTART 35</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2051" title="HISTART 51" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 51');">HISTART 51</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2062" title="HISTART 62" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 62');">HISTART 62</a></span>, etc.<br/>
3 unit lecture courses.</p>

<p>Additional requirement: These three courses must include one course in Western art and one course in non-Western art.</p>
<h5>B. One Art Practice/Materials Course (2-4 units)</h5>
<p>Students must complete 2, 3, or 4 units in a course that introduces specific art making practices and/or the study of the materials of art. This course must be approved in advance by an undergraduate adviser in the History of Art Department. It may be taken P/NP. Applicable courses are typically offered in the Practice of Art Department, College of Environmental Design, and program in New Media Studies. Students may also take courses that involve the making of art occasionally taught in the department.</p>
<h4>II. Upper Division Requirements (7 or 8 courses)</h4>
<p>In their upper division coursework in History of Art (total 26-28 units; 8 of these units in seminars), each student must take courses in four of the following five geographical areas and one course in each of the chronological periods.</p>
<h5>Geographical: </h5>
<ol>
	<li>Europe and the Mediterranean </li>
	<li>Asia and the Pacific </li>
	<li>The Americas </li>
	<li>Middle East and Africa</li>
	<li>Transcultural</li>
</ol>
<h5>Chronological:</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Prehistoric-1200</li>
	<li>1200-1800</li>
	<li>1800-present</li>
</ol>
<p>Upper division lecture courses (3 or 4 units) and seminars (2 or 4 units) may fulfill these breadth requirements. Upper division classes (lecture or seminar) can fulfill both a geographical requirement and a chronological requirement.</p>
<h5>A. Five Lecture Courses (18-20 units)</h5>
<p>Up to two of these courses may be 3 unit courses.</p>
<h5>B. Seminars (8 units)</h5>
<p>Students in the major are required to complete 8 units of seminar study, of which 4 units (incorporating a research paper component) must be in their Focus of Study. The remaining 4 units may be taken as follows:</p>
<p>A second 4-unit seminar with research paper.</p>
<p><strong>Or</strong></p>
<p>Two 2-unit seminars without research papers. Individual faculty members will decide when a given seminar can be taken for 2 units. Two-unit seminars require active participation and completion of weekly readings and writing assignments. Four-unit seminars add a final research paper.</p>
<h4>III. Additional Requirements (1 or 2 courses)</h4>
<h5>A. Theories/Methods Course (4 units)</h5>
<p>All students in the major are required to take either <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20100" title="HISTART 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 100');">HISTART 100</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20101" title="HISTART 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 101');">HISTART 101</a></span>. These courses, offered in fall and spring semesters, focus on historiography and theoretical/philosophical models in the History of Art, on practical methods of art historical inquiry, or a combination thereof. Students should take <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20100" title="HISTART 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 100');">HISTART 100</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20101" title="HISTART 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 101');">HISTART 101</a></span> early in their work in the major. We encourage students intending to pursue graduate training in the History of Art or related disciplines to take both courses.</p>

<h5>B. Upper Division Course Outside the Department (3 or 4 units)</h5>
<p>Required only for students who declared prior to Fall 2017.</p>
<p>Students must take, for a letter grade, one upper division lecture course or seminar in another department. The course should support each student's Focus of Study in art history.

			</div>
			<div id="advisingtextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><h3>Department Advising</h3>
<p>Declared majors must see an undergraduate adviser at least once each semester during the registration period (advisers are listed on the department website). These advising meetings provide majors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty member who can help them develop an overall program of study well-suited to individual strengths and career goals. The advisers also apprise majors of special courses and opportunities, both in the History of Art Department and elsewhere. Please note that faculty advisers are typically not available during the summer and winter breaks. Advising appointments can be made by signing up <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-welcome/" target="_blank">online.</a></p>
<p>In addition to general advising and coursework approval, advisers must approve all changes in registration, including withdrawals and add-drop changes, certain special study courses  (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20193" title="HISTART 193" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 193');">HISTART 193</a> Directed Research</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20194" title="HISTART 194" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 194');">HISTART 194</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20H195" title="HISTART H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART H195');">HISTART H195</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20C196W" title="HISTART C196W" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART C196W');">HISTART C196W</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20199" title="HISTART 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 199');">HISTART 199</a></span>), and some special programs. Appointments should be made well in advance of deadlines.</p>

<p>Each semester during the course enrollment period History of Art majors must see the undergraduate major adviser to discuss their program of study to release their advisor hold in order to gain access to the course enrollment system. Students should sign up for an advising appointment prior to their enrollment phase, having considered carefully the department’s course descriptions and having planned a schedule of proposed courses to be discussed with the adviser. Special additional office hours are held during enrollment periods, and advisers may decline to provide last-minute advising. Adviser holds will only be released over the phone or via email if a student is studying abroad or is physically incapacitated.</p>
<p>Department undergraduate advisers do not administer or approve coursework or degree requirements in the College of Letters &amp; Science other than the requirements of the major. For L&amp;S requirements, students should make an appointment to see an L&amp;S adviser in 206 Evans Hall.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for All Majors</h3>
<p>Foreign languages are not required in lower or upper division courses but a reading knowledge of European or Asian languages may be helpful in seminars and other research courses. Students planning on graduate study in the History of Art are urged to develop a reading knowledge of German and French or Italian as early as possible. Special language requirements pertain for graduate study in ancient and Asian art.</p>
<p>Recommended course load in History of Art will vary according to the student, course level, and individual course requirements. In general, no more than two History of Art courses per semester are recommended. A student’s final academic year may include a greater number of courses in History of Art, especially if all L&amp;S breadth requirements have been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Special programs, such as study abroad, internships, and double majoring require considerable advance planning. If you are interested in any of these, discuss your plans early with your adviser. Courses taken through study abroad must be discussed in advance with an adviser and will not be formally approved until after completion and until satisfactory documentation has been submitted. In order for courses taken abroad to satisfy major requirements, the breadth and depth of the course, the work demanded, and your performance must all meet Berkeley upper division standards. Your performance will be evaluated by a faculty adviser upon your return to campus to determine whether major requirements have been satisfied. Please see the department Study Abroad Information sheet.</p>
<p>Students with special intellectual or preprofessional interests may wish to enroll in independent study or research courses (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20193" title="HISTART 193" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 193');">HISTART 193</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20199" title="HISTART 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 199');">HISTART 199</a></span>), in a second seminar (192), or in additional, related courses in other departments. These students should discuss their interests with their advisers as early as possible.</p>

<h3>Letters of Recommendation</h3>
<p>Students should plan to request letters of recommendation from those faculty members with whom they have studied most closely, especially in seminars and other special study courses. General letters of reference for employment, internships, or graduate school/professional programs, may be placed on file with the <a href="https://career.berkeley.edu/Letter/Letter" target="_blank">Career Center</a> (2440 Bancroft Way).</p>
<h3>Graduate Study </h3>
<p>Students who anticipate applying to graduate schools should discuss their plans with their adviser or with the faculty member whose field most closely corresponds to their interests. If you plan to begin graduate study in the fall after your graduation from Berkeley, you will have to prepare applications in the fall of your senior year. Most schools have deadlines in December though February, especially if the application is made for both admission and fellowship support. Arrangements should also be made in the fall of your senior year for taking the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) or other graduate entrance exams that many schools require.</p>

			<div id="academicopportunitiestextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Department and University Honors</h3>
<p><strong>Honors in Art History</strong>: Students with a 3.7 GPA in the major may complete and submit an honors thesis by enrolling in HA195 (4 units, graded). A student whose thesis receives a grade of A- or better will receive Departmental Honors (Honors, High Honors, or Highest Honors). The Honors Thesis is a two-semester project conducted under faculty supervision, as follows: a seminar, upper division lecture, directed research, or independent study course in the first semester, followed by HA195 in the second. For specific details regarding the Honors Program, students should speak with a faculty undergraduate advisor and read the <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-major-requirements/honors-thesis/">Guidelines for the Preparation of Theses</a>.</p>
<p><strong>University honors</strong><span> are awarded to students on the basis of overall GPA as follows: Distinction, High Distinction, and Highest Distinction (roughly equivalent to cum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cum laude). Requisite GPAs for University honors change each year. In 2016-2017 they were: Distinction: 3.724; High Distinction: 3.845; Highest Distinction: 3.947.</span></p>
<p><strong>Maybelle M. Toombs Awards </strong>recognize the potential talent and ability of students based upon their record in the major up to the beginning of the senior year. By that time, the students must have completed at least two semesters of coursework as a History of Art major at Berkeley. Criteria for the award are outstanding grade point average and receiving financial aid. The award carries a stipend payable in the student's senior year for research and travel.</p>
<p>For the <strong>Departmental Citation</strong>, presented at Commencement to a graduating senior, the Departmental Award Committee considers grades to be the principal criterion, but it also takes into account the character of the student's overall program, its ambition and depth; the student's ability to sustain a high level of excellence throughout his or her undergraduate work, from the freshman to the senior year, in the Art History Department as well as in other subjects; and the ways in which this broad experience is brought to bear in an honors thesis of high quality, one that notably demonstrates the ability to do research in the discipline and a genuine independence of mind and maturity of judgment.</p>
<h3>Brochures, Announcements, and Files </h3>
<p>Announcements and brochures on graduate study, internships, work experience, fellowships, study abroad, training programs, and special lectures and symposia are posted on the departmental bulletin board or distributed by email. If you are interested in a particular program and need more information, please contact the undergraduate student services adviser.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Association</h3>
<p>The History of Art Undergraduate Student Association (H.Art) is an official campus group that exists to serve the interests of the department's majors. In the past, the association has compiled an internship directory, hosted a student-faculty brunch, sponsored special lunchtime talks with faculty and graduate students, and assisted in organizing career seminars. All majors are invited and encouraged to participate in the association. If you would like more information please leave a message in the association's mailbox in 416 Doe or speak with the undergraduate student services adviser. </p>

An introduction to the historical circumstances and visual character of Western art from the Renaissance to the present. Not a chronological survey, but an exploration of topics and themes central to this period. For example: What tasks did painting and sculpture perform in the past? For whom, at whose expense? How do the rise of landscape painting, the cult of the artist, and the new emphasis on the nude relate to the emergence of modern society? Do stylistic labels</span><span class="deschide"> like Classicism, Realism, Impressionism, and Modernism help us answer such questions? This course is recommended for potential majors and for students in other disciplines, both humanities and sciences.</span><br/>

This course is an introduction to the visual arts of Europe and the USA from the 14th century to the present day. This course will attempt to situate works of art into long, general trends in art practice of the Western tradition, though it will prioritize sustained focus on single case-studies which punctuate the five centuries of art for which this course offers a historical account; attention will also gather around particular representative</span><span class="deschide"> artists’ careers. We’ll explore how the fine arts can be considered as part of wider visual culture(s) in the Western tradition, and the ways art within such a broad tradition can function both as a stabilizing and as a transformative force within social/political/religious/racial/etc contexts.</span><br/>

This course introduces students to the rich museum culture of London. Through lectures, seminars, and visits to museums we will explore how museums create histories of art, society, and national identity. The course draws on the approaches of several disciplines–art, social, and cultural history, anthropology, social geography, and critical theory–to interrogate the ways that museums reflect and shape what we know and how we see. Exploring a selection of</span><span class="deschide"> sites dating from the 18th century to the present day, we will consider the historical context in which these museums came about, the nature of their collections, and debates on current presentation, considering issues of museology, curatorial practice, and the construction of knowledge.</span><br/>

Rather than follow a master chronology that would attempt to contain Africa’s multiple cultural formations in a single narrative, this course will introduce students to African art through an investigation of a range of aesthetic traditions and movements across sub-Saharan Africa that are meaningfully reinvigorated in contemporary artistic production and popular visual culture. Our continual return to the cultural politics of the present will provide</span><span class="deschide"> an anchor and roadmap for our inquiry; we will see contemporary visual culture as staging interventions that push at Western ideas of “primitive African tradition,” while bringing to the fore conventions that, when tracked, reveal alternative traditions legible within an art historical context.</span><br/>

Thus, we will study Buddhism and Hinduism in the early Common Era, early modern Islamic art, and encounters with Europe fueled by colonialism.

This course is an introduction to the art and architecture of modern South, Southeast, and East Asia. Using a comparative perspective, each week will focus on a set of case studies—the work of particular artists and art movements or the architecture of specific Asian cities—to reconstruct an expansive history of modern art and architecture in Asia from 1800 to the present. Class lectures will be completed by a close examination of modern Asian art collections on campus</span><span class="deschide"> and in the Bay Area. We will also engage with numerous diasporic Asian artists who live and work in the area.<br/></span><br/>

Conversion often refers to changing religions. This process can be personal or historical, involve a single individual or entire groups, such as at the moment of colonization of the Americas, when thousands of indigenous people were forcibly or willingly converted to Christianity.

Does the converter become curious about and</span><span class="deschide"> affected by the beliefs of those he tries to gain over to his religion?

Important individuals in Greek and Roman society were commemorated both in honorific portraits—bronze and marble statues set up in public places—and in biographies written to record for posterity their lives and achievements. We will be reading a selection of Greek and Latin biographical texts (in translation) and comparing them with statuary monuments that represent the same individuals. We will be seeking to elicit the points of contact between the two commemorative</span><span class="deschide"> traditions, visual and literary, and to understand the sometimes similar functions they serve. But we will also be attempting to bring out the differences in the way that biographical texts and portrait images operate, and the consequences this has for historians.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>History of Art Major Program</h3>
<p>The Major in History of Art is designed to give students solid grounding in the artistic traditions, practices, and contexts that comprise historical and contemporary visuality. Equally, it introduces the discipline’s history, methods, and debates. It prepares students to do independent research, to evaluate evidence, to create coherent and sustained arguments, and to develop skills in academic writing. In a series of increasingly focused courses — lower division, upper division, seminar, and honors program — the major provides a format for students to learn how to analyze and interpret visual, material, and textual evidence from specific cultural settings and historical circumstances. Major requirements are also designed to maximize exposure to different historical periods, geographical regions, and topics while allowing flexibility for students to pursue specific interests by selecting a Focus of Study.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>To declare the major in the History of Art Department, a student must complete two courses taught in the department and receive a grade of C- or higher in each course. All subsequent courses a student wishes to apply to the major must also receive a grade of C- or higher. Once these prerequisites are met, students may formally petition to declare the major by making an appointment with an Undergraduate Adviser at any time during the fall and spring semesters. (Students in residence at UC Berkeley are strongly urged to complete all lower division requirements and one upper division course by the end of their sophomore year.) <strong>Transfer students should plan to take two History of Art courses in their first semester.</strong></p>
<p>Majors who declare early, especially in the sophomore year, enjoy several advantages:</p>
<p><span>1. A more thorough preparation for seminars and time to study more closely with several members of the faculty.</span></p>
<p>2. Greater flexibility in coordinating major requirements with College of Letters &amp; Science (L&amp;S) requirements and in planning a sequence of courses that allows for special courses or programs of study, e.g., study abroad, curatorial internships, independent study, a double-major, and the honors program.</p>
<p>3. Time for a generally higher level of study in the senior year, and opportunity to experiment with and prepare for diverse career opportunities.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with at least a 3.7 grade point average (GPA) in the History of Art major are eligible for admission into the honors program. Candidates for honors in History of Art are required to complete satisfactorily, within their senior year, an honors thesis consisting of at least two semesters of continuing academic work under faculty supervision (usually a seminar, directed research, or independent study course in the first semester plus, in the second semester, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20H195" title="HISTART H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART H195');">HISTART H195</a></span>). Those who have completed the program will graduate with honors, high honors, or highest honors in the major depending upon their final GPA in all upper division courses taken to fulfill the major requirements. Please see the department's <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-major-requirements/honors-thesis/">honors program webpage</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The minor program in the History of Art Department is designed to provide a structured and broad program for those students majoring in other disciplines but with a strong interest in the history of art. For information regarding declaring the minor, please contact the department.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p><span>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</span></p>
<h3>The History of Art Major Program (41-52 units)</h3>
<h4>I. Lower Division Requirements (4 courses)</h4>
<h5>A. Three History of Art Courses (9-12 units)</h5>
<p>Majors must complete 9 to 12 units of lower division course work in the History of Art Department. These units may come from courses taken in the department, courses taken at other institutions granted transfer credit for the major by the department, or from AP Art History (score of 4 or 5). Courses that qualify for lower division requirements include:</p>
<p>4 unit lecture courses: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2010" title="HISTART 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 10');">HISTART 10</a></span> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2011" title="HISTART 11" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 11');">HISTART 11</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2034" title="HISTART 34" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 34');">HISTART 34</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2035" title="HISTART 35" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 35');">HISTART 35</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2051" title="HISTART 51" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 51');">HISTART 51</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2062" title="HISTART 62" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 62');">HISTART 62</a></span>, etc.<br/>
3 unit lecture courses.</p>

<p>Additional requirement: These three courses must include one course in Western art and one course in non-Western art.</p>
<h5>B. One Art Practice/Materials Course (2-4 units)</h5>
<p>Students must complete 2, 3, or 4 units in a course that introduces specific art making practices and/or the study of the materials of art. This course must be approved in advance by an undergraduate adviser in the History of Art Department. It may be taken P/NP. Applicable courses are typically offered in the Practice of Art Department, College of Environmental Design, and program in New Media Studies. Students may also take courses that involve the making of art occasionally taught in the department.</p>
<h4>II. Upper Division Requirements (7 or 8 courses)</h4>
<p>In their upper division coursework in History of Art (total 26-28 units; 8 of these units in seminars), each student must take courses in four of the following five geographical areas and one course in each of the chronological periods.</p>
<h5>Geographical: </h5>
<ol>
	<li>Europe and the Mediterranean </li>
	<li>Asia and the Pacific </li>
	<li>The Americas </li>
	<li>Middle East and Africa</li>
	<li>Transcultural</li>
</ol>
<h5>Chronological:</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Prehistoric-1200</li>
	<li>1200-1800</li>
	<li>1800-present</li>
</ol>
<p>Upper division lecture courses (3 or 4 units) and seminars (2 or 4 units) may fulfill these breadth requirements. Upper division classes (lecture or seminar) can fulfill both a geographical requirement and a chronological requirement.</p>
<h5>A. Five Lecture Courses (18-20 units)</h5>
<p>Up to two of these courses may be 3 unit courses.</p>
<h5>B. Seminars (8 units)</h5>
<p>Students in the major are required to complete 8 units of seminar study, of which 4 units (incorporating a research paper component) must be in their Focus of Study. The remaining 4 units may be taken as follows:</p>
<p>A second 4-unit seminar with research paper.</p>
<p><strong>Or</strong></p>
<p>Two 2-unit seminars without research papers. Individual faculty members will decide when a given seminar can be taken for 2 units. Two-unit seminars require active participation and completion of weekly readings and writing assignments. Four-unit seminars add a final research paper.</p>
<h4>III. Additional Requirements (1 or 2 courses)</h4>
<h5>A. Theories/Methods Course (4 units)</h5>
<p>All students in the major are required to take either <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20100" title="HISTART 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 100');">HISTART 100</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20101" title="HISTART 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 101');">HISTART 101</a></span>. These courses, offered in fall and spring semesters, focus on historiography and theoretical/philosophical models in the History of Art, on practical methods of art historical inquiry, or a combination thereof. Students should take <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20100" title="HISTART 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 100');">HISTART 100</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20101" title="HISTART 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 101');">HISTART 101</a></span> early in their work in the major. We encourage students intending to pursue graduate training in the History of Art or related disciplines to take both courses.</p>

<h5>B. Upper Division Course Outside the Department (3 or 4 units)</h5>
<p>Required only for students who declared prior to Fall 2017.</p>
<p>Students must take, for a letter grade, one upper division lecture course or seminar in another department. The course should support each student's Focus of Study in art history.

			</div>
			<div id="advisingtextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><h3>Department Advising</h3>
<p>Declared majors must see an undergraduate adviser at least once each semester during the registration period (advisers are listed on the department website). These advising meetings provide majors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty member who can help them develop an overall program of study well-suited to individual strengths and career goals. The advisers also apprise majors of special courses and opportunities, both in the History of Art Department and elsewhere. Please note that faculty advisers are typically not available during the summer and winter breaks. Advising appointments can be made by signing up <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-welcome/" target="_blank">online.</a></p>
<p>In addition to general advising and coursework approval, advisers must approve all changes in registration, including withdrawals and add-drop changes, certain special study courses  (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20193" title="HISTART 193" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 193');">HISTART 193</a> Directed Research</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20194" title="HISTART 194" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 194');">HISTART 194</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20H195" title="HISTART H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART H195');">HISTART H195</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20C196W" title="HISTART C196W" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART C196W');">HISTART C196W</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20199" title="HISTART 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 199');">HISTART 199</a></span>), and some special programs. Appointments should be made well in advance of deadlines.</p>

<p>Each semester during the course enrollment period History of Art majors must see the undergraduate major adviser to discuss their program of study to release their advisor hold in order to gain access to the course enrollment system. Students should sign up for an advising appointment prior to their enrollment phase, having considered carefully the department’s course descriptions and having planned a schedule of proposed courses to be discussed with the adviser. Special additional office hours are held during enrollment periods, and advisers may decline to provide last-minute advising. Adviser holds will only be released over the phone or via email if a student is studying abroad or is physically incapacitated.</p>
<p>Department undergraduate advisers do not administer or approve coursework or degree requirements in the College of Letters &amp; Science other than the requirements of the major. For L&amp;S requirements, students should make an appointment to see an L&amp;S adviser in 206 Evans Hall.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for All Majors</h3>
<p>Foreign languages are not required in lower or upper division courses but a reading knowledge of European or Asian languages may be helpful in seminars and other research courses. Students planning on graduate study in the History of Art are urged to develop a reading knowledge of German and French or Italian as early as possible. Special language requirements pertain for graduate study in ancient and Asian art.</p>
<p>Recommended course load in History of Art will vary according to the student, course level, and individual course requirements. In general, no more than two History of Art courses per semester are recommended. A student’s final academic year may include a greater number of courses in History of Art, especially if all L&amp;S breadth requirements have been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Special programs, such as study abroad, internships, and double majoring require considerable advance planning. If you are interested in any of these, discuss your plans early with your adviser. Courses taken through study abroad must be discussed in advance with an adviser and will not be formally approved until after completion and until satisfactory documentation has been submitted. In order for courses taken abroad to satisfy major requirements, the breadth and depth of the course, the work demanded, and your performance must all meet Berkeley upper division standards. Your performance will be evaluated by a faculty adviser upon your return to campus to determine whether major requirements have been satisfied. Please see the department Study Abroad Information sheet.</p>
<p>Students with special intellectual or preprofessional interests may wish to enroll in independent study or research courses (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20193" title="HISTART 193" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 193');">HISTART 193</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20199" title="HISTART 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 199');">HISTART 199</a></span>), in a second seminar (192), or in additional, related courses in other departments. These students should discuss their interests with their advisers as early as possible.</p>

<h3>Letters of Recommendation</h3>
<p>Students should plan to request letters of recommendation from those faculty members with whom they have studied most closely, especially in seminars and other special study courses. General letters of reference for employment, internships, or graduate school/professional programs, may be placed on file with the <a href="https://career.berkeley.edu/Letter/Letter" target="_blank">Career Center</a> (2440 Bancroft Way).</p>
<h3>Graduate Study </h3>
<p>Students who anticipate applying to graduate schools should discuss their plans with their adviser or with the faculty member whose field most closely corresponds to their interests. If you plan to begin graduate study in the fall after your graduation from Berkeley, you will have to prepare applications in the fall of your senior year. Most schools have deadlines in December though February, especially if the application is made for both admission and fellowship support. Arrangements should also be made in the fall of your senior year for taking the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) or other graduate entrance exams that many schools require.</p>

			<div id="academicopportunitiestextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Department and University Honors</h3>
<p><strong>Honors in Art History</strong>: Students with a 3.7 GPA in the major may complete and submit an honors thesis by enrolling in HA195 (4 units, graded). A student whose thesis receives a grade of A- or better will receive Departmental Honors (Honors, High Honors, or Highest Honors). The Honors Thesis is a two-semester project conducted under faculty supervision, as follows: a seminar, upper division lecture, directed research, or independent study course in the first semester, followed by HA195 in the second. For specific details regarding the Honors Program, students should speak with a faculty undergraduate advisor and read the <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-major-requirements/honors-thesis/">Guidelines for the Preparation of Theses</a>.</p>
<p><strong>University honors</strong><span> are awarded to students on the basis of overall GPA as follows: Distinction, High Distinction, and Highest Distinction (roughly equivalent to cum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cum laude). Requisite GPAs for University honors change each year. In 2016-2017 they were: Distinction: 3.724; High Distinction: 3.845; Highest Distinction: 3.947.</span></p>
<p><strong>Maybelle M. Toombs Awards </strong>recognize the potential talent and ability of students based upon their record in the major up to the beginning of the senior year. By that time, the students must have completed at least two semesters of coursework as a History of Art major at Berkeley. Criteria for the award are outstanding grade point average and receiving financial aid. The award carries a stipend payable in the student's senior year for research and travel.</p>
<p>For the <strong>Departmental Citation</strong>, presented at Commencement to a graduating senior, the Departmental Award Committee considers grades to be the principal criterion, but it also takes into account the character of the student's overall program, its ambition and depth; the student's ability to sustain a high level of excellence throughout his or her undergraduate work, from the freshman to the senior year, in the Art History Department as well as in other subjects; and the ways in which this broad experience is brought to bear in an honors thesis of high quality, one that notably demonstrates the ability to do research in the discipline and a genuine independence of mind and maturity of judgment.</p>
<h3>Brochures, Announcements, and Files </h3>
<p>Announcements and brochures on graduate study, internships, work experience, fellowships, study abroad, training programs, and special lectures and symposia are posted on the departmental bulletin board or distributed by email. If you are interested in a particular program and need more information, please contact the undergraduate student services adviser.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Association</h3>
<p>The History of Art Undergraduate Student Association (H.Art) is an official campus group that exists to serve the interests of the department's majors. In the past, the association has compiled an internship directory, hosted a student-faculty brunch, sponsored special lunchtime talks with faculty and graduate students, and assisted in organizing career seminars. All majors are invited and encouraged to participate in the association. If you would like more information please leave a message in the association's mailbox in 416 Doe or speak with the undergraduate student services adviser. </p>

This course is an introduction to the visual arts of Europe and the USA from the 14th century to the present day. This course will attempt to situate works of art into long, general trends in art practice of the Western tradition, though it will prioritize sustained focus on single case-studies which punctuate the five centuries of art for which this course offers a historical account; attention will also gather around particular representative</span><span class="deschide"> artists’ careers. We’ll explore how the fine arts can be considered as part of wider visual culture(s) in the Western tradition, and the ways art within such a broad tradition can function both as a stabilizing and as a transformative force within social/political/religious/racial/etc contexts.</span><br/>

This course introduces students to the rich museum culture of London. Through lectures, seminars, and visits to museums we will explore how museums create histories of art, society, and national identity. The course draws on the approaches of several disciplines–art, social, and cultural history, anthropology, social geography, and critical theory–to interrogate the ways that museums reflect and shape what we know and how we see. Exploring a selection of</span><span class="deschide"> sites dating from the 18th century to the present day, we will consider the historical context in which these museums came about, the nature of their collections, and debates on current presentation, considering issues of museology, curatorial practice, and the construction of knowledge.</span><br/>

Rather than follow a master chronology that would attempt to contain Africa’s multiple cultural formations in a single narrative, this course will introduce students to African art through an investigation of a range of aesthetic traditions and movements across sub-Saharan Africa that are meaningfully reinvigorated in contemporary artistic production and popular visual culture. Our continual return to the cultural politics of the present will provide</span><span class="deschide"> an anchor and roadmap for our inquiry; we will see contemporary visual culture as staging interventions that push at Western ideas of “primitive African tradition,” while bringing to the fore conventions that, when tracked, reveal alternative traditions legible within an art historical context.</span><br/>

Proceeding in a chronological order, we will engage with key moments of artistic production in the region. We will locate art and architecture within the larger world of political economies, religion and philosophy, gender and sexuality, urbanity, and state formations to generate the depth and context required for</span><span class="deschide"> understanding South and Southeast Asia through a historical frame. Thus, we will study Buddhism and Hinduism in the early Common Era, early modern Islamic art, and encounters with Europe fueled by colonialism.

This course is an introduction to the art and architecture of modern South, Southeast, and East Asia. Using a comparative perspective, each week will focus on a set of case studies—the work of particular artists and art movements or the architecture of specific Asian cities—to reconstruct an expansive history of modern art and architecture in Asia from 1800 to the present. Class lectures will be completed by a close examination of modern Asian art collections on campus</span><span class="deschide"> and in the Bay Area. We will also engage with numerous diasporic Asian artists who live and work in the area.<br/></span><br/>

Conversion often refers to changing religions. This process can be personal or historical, involve a single individual or entire groups, such as at the moment of colonization of the Americas, when thousands of indigenous people were forcibly or willingly converted to Christianity.

Does the converter become curious about and</span><span class="deschide"> affected by the beliefs of those he tries to gain over to his religion? What implications does this have for art, technology, thought?

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>History of Art Major Program</h3>
<p>The Major in History of Art is designed to give students solid grounding in the artistic traditions, practices, and contexts that comprise historical and contemporary visuality. Equally, it introduces the discipline’s history, methods, and debates. It prepares students to do independent research, to evaluate evidence, to create coherent and sustained arguments, and to develop skills in academic writing. In a series of increasingly focused courses — lower division, upper division, seminar, and honors program — the major provides a format for students to learn how to analyze and interpret visual, material, and textual evidence from specific cultural settings and historical circumstances. Major requirements are also designed to maximize exposure to different historical periods, geographical regions, and topics while allowing flexibility for students to pursue specific interests by selecting a Focus of Study.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>To declare the major in the History of Art Department, a student must complete two courses taught in the department and receive a grade of C- or higher in each course. All subsequent courses a student wishes to apply to the major must also receive a grade of C- or higher. Once these prerequisites are met, students may formally petition to declare the major by making an appointment with an Undergraduate Adviser at any time during the fall and spring semesters. (Students in residence at UC Berkeley are strongly urged to complete all lower division requirements and one upper division course by the end of their sophomore year.) <strong>Transfer students should plan to take two History of Art courses in their first semester.</strong></p>
<p>Majors who declare early, especially in the sophomore year, enjoy several advantages:</p>
<p><span>1. A more thorough preparation for seminars and time to study more closely with several members of the faculty.</span></p>
<p>2. Greater flexibility in coordinating major requirements with College of Letters &amp; Science (L&amp;S) requirements and in planning a sequence of courses that allows for special courses or programs of study, e.g., study abroad, curatorial internships, independent study, a double-major, and the honors program.</p>
<p>3. Time for a generally higher level of study in the senior year, and opportunity to experiment with and prepare for diverse career opportunities.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with at least a 3.7 grade point average (GPA) in the History of Art major are eligible for admission into the honors program. Candidates for honors in History of Art are required to complete satisfactorily, within their senior year, an honors thesis consisting of at least two semesters of continuing academic work under faculty supervision (usually a seminar, directed research, or independent study course in the first semester plus, in the second semester, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20H195" title="HISTART H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART H195');">HISTART H195</a></span>). Those who have completed the program will graduate with honors, high honors, or highest honors in the major depending upon their final GPA in all upper division courses taken to fulfill the major requirements. Please see the department's <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-major-requirements/honors-thesis/">honors program webpage</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The minor program in the History of Art Department is designed to provide a structured and broad program for those students majoring in other disciplines but with a strong interest in the history of art. For information regarding declaring the minor, please contact the department.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

<h4>I. Lower Division Requirements (4 courses)</h4>
<h5>A. Three History of Art Courses (9-12 units)</h5>
<p>Majors must complete 9 to 12 units of lower division course work in the History of Art Department. These units may come from courses taken in the department, courses taken at other institutions granted transfer credit for the major by the department, or from AP Art History (score of 4 or 5). Courses that qualify for lower division requirements include:</p>
<p>4 unit lecture courses: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2010" title="HISTART 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 10');">HISTART 10</a></span> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2011" title="HISTART 11" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 11');">HISTART 11</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2034" title="HISTART 34" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 34');">HISTART 34</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2035" title="HISTART 35" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 35');">HISTART 35</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2051" title="HISTART 51" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 51');">HISTART 51</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2062" title="HISTART 62" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 62');">HISTART 62</a></span>, etc.<br/>
3 unit lecture courses.</p>

<p>Additional requirement: These three courses must include one course in Western art and one course in non-Western art.</p>
<h5>B. One Art Practice/Materials Course (2-4 units)</h5>
<p>Students must complete 2, 3, or 4 units in a course that introduces specific art making practices and/or the study of the materials of art. This course must be approved in advance by an undergraduate adviser in the History of Art Department. It may be taken P/NP. Applicable courses are typically offered in the Practice of Art Department, College of Environmental Design, and program in New Media Studies. Students may also take courses that involve the making of art occasionally taught in the department.</p>
<h4>II. Upper Division Requirements (7 or 8 courses)</h4>
<p>In their upper division coursework in History of Art (total 26-28 units; 8 of these units in seminars), each student must take courses in four of the following five geographical areas and one course in each of the chronological periods.</p>
<h5>Geographical: </h5>
<ol>
	<li>Europe and the Mediterranean </li>
	<li>Asia and the Pacific </li>
	<li>The Americas </li>
	<li>Middle East and Africa</li>
	<li>Transcultural</li>
</ol>
<h5>Chronological:</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Prehistoric-1200</li>
	<li>1200-1800</li>
	<li>1800-present</li>
</ol>
<p>Upper division lecture courses (3 or 4 units) and seminars (2 or 4 units) may fulfill these breadth requirements. Upper division classes (lecture or seminar) can fulfill both a geographical requirement and a chronological requirement.</p>
<h5>A. Five Lecture Courses (18-20 units)</h5>
<p>Up to two of these courses may be 3 unit courses.</p>
<h5>B. Seminars (8 units)</h5>
<p>Students in the major are required to complete 8 units of seminar study, of which 4 units (incorporating a research paper component) must be in their Focus of Study. The remaining 4 units may be taken as follows:</p>
<p>A second 4-unit seminar with research paper.</p>
<p><strong>Or</strong></p>
<p>Two 2-unit seminars without research papers. Individual faculty members will decide when a given seminar can be taken for 2 units. Two-unit seminars require active participation and completion of weekly readings and writing assignments. Four-unit seminars add a final research paper.</p>
<h4>III. Additional Requirements (1 or 2 courses)</h4>
<h5>A. Theories/Methods Course (4 units)</h5>
<p>All students in the major are required to take either <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20100" title="HISTART 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 100');">HISTART 100</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20101" title="HISTART 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 101');">HISTART 101</a></span>. These courses, offered in fall and spring semesters, focus on historiography and theoretical/philosophical models in the History of Art, on practical methods of art historical inquiry, or a combination thereof. Students should take <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20100" title="HISTART 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 100');">HISTART 100</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20101" title="HISTART 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 101');">HISTART 101</a></span> early in their work in the major. We encourage students intending to pursue graduate training in the History of Art or related disciplines to take both courses.</p>

			</div>
			<div id="advisingtextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><h3>Department Advising</h3>
<p>Declared majors must see an undergraduate adviser at least once each semester during the registration period (advisers are listed on the department website). These advising meetings provide majors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty member who can help them develop an overall program of study well-suited to individual strengths and career goals. The advisers also apprise majors of special courses and opportunities, both in the History of Art Department and elsewhere. Please note that faculty advisers are typically not available during the summer and winter breaks. Advising appointments can be made by signing up <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-welcome/" target="_blank">online.</a></p>
<p>In addition to general advising and coursework approval, advisers must approve all changes in registration, including withdrawals and add-drop changes, certain special study courses  (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20193" title="HISTART 193" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 193');">HISTART 193</a> Directed Research</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20194" title="HISTART 194" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 194');">HISTART 194</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20H195" title="HISTART H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART H195');">HISTART H195</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20C196W" title="HISTART C196W" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART C196W');">HISTART C196W</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20199" title="HISTART 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 199');">HISTART 199</a></span>), and some special programs. Appointments should be made well in advance of deadlines.</p>

<p>Each semester during the course enrollment period History of Art majors must see the undergraduate major adviser to discuss their program of study to release their advisor hold in order to gain access to the course enrollment system. Students should sign up for an advising appointment prior to their enrollment phase, having considered carefully the department’s course descriptions and having planned a schedule of proposed courses to be discussed with the adviser. Special additional office hours are held during enrollment periods, and advisers may decline to provide last-minute advising. Adviser holds will only be released over the phone or via email if a student is studying abroad or is physically incapacitated.</p>
<p>Department undergraduate advisers do not administer or approve coursework or degree requirements in the College of Letters &amp; Science other than the requirements of the major. For L&amp;S requirements, students should make an appointment to see an L&amp;S adviser in 206 Evans Hall.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for All Majors</h3>
<p>Foreign languages are not required in lower or upper division courses but a reading knowledge of European or Asian languages may be helpful in seminars and other research courses. Students planning on graduate study in the History of Art are urged to develop a reading knowledge of German and French or Italian as early as possible. Special language requirements pertain for graduate study in ancient and Asian art.</p>
<p>Recommended course load in History of Art will vary according to the student, course level, and individual course requirements. In general, no more than two History of Art courses per semester are recommended. A student’s final academic year may include a greater number of courses in History of Art, especially if all L&amp;S breadth requirements have been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Special programs, such as study abroad, internships, and double majoring require considerable advance planning. If you are interested in any of these, discuss your plans early with your adviser. Courses taken through study abroad must be discussed in advance with an adviser and will not be formally approved until after completion and until satisfactory documentation has been submitted. In order for courses taken abroad to satisfy major requirements, the breadth and depth of the course, the work demanded, and your performance must all meet Berkeley upper division standards. Your performance will be evaluated by a faculty adviser upon your return to campus to determine whether major requirements have been satisfied. Please see the department Study Abroad Information sheet.</p>
<p>Students with special intellectual or preprofessional interests may wish to enroll in independent study or research courses (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20193" title="HISTART 193" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 193');">HISTART 193</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20199" title="HISTART 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 199');">HISTART 199</a></span>), in a second seminar (192), or in additional, related courses in other departments. These students should discuss their interests with their advisers as early as possible.</p>

<h3>Letters of Recommendation</h3>
<p>Students should plan to request letters of recommendation from those faculty members with whom they have studied most closely, especially in seminars and other special study courses. General letters of reference for employment, internships, or graduate school/professional programs, may be placed on file with the <a href="https://career.berkeley.edu/Letter/Letter" target="_blank">Career Center</a> (2440 Bancroft Way).</p>
<h3>Graduate Study </h3>
<p>Students who anticipate applying to graduate schools should discuss their plans with their adviser or with the faculty member whose field most closely corresponds to their interests. If you plan to begin graduate study in the fall after your graduation from Berkeley, you will have to prepare applications in the fall of your senior year. Most schools have deadlines in December though February, especially if the application is made for both admission and fellowship support. Arrangements should also be made in the fall of your senior year for taking the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) or other graduate entrance exams that many schools require.</p>

			<div id="academicopportunitiestextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Department and University Honors</h3>
<p><strong>Honors in Art History</strong>: Students with a 3.7 GPA in the major may complete and submit an honors thesis by enrolling in HA195 (4 units, graded). A student whose thesis receives a grade of A- or better will receive Departmental Honors (Honors, High Honors, or Highest Honors). The Honors Thesis is a two-semester project conducted under faculty supervision, as follows: a seminar, upper division lecture, directed research, or independent study course in the first semester, followed by HA195 in the second. For specific details regarding the Honors Program, students should speak with a faculty undergraduate advisor and read the <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-major-requirements/honors-thesis/">Guidelines for the Preparation of Theses</a>.</p>
<p><strong>University honors</strong><span> are awarded to students on the basis of overall GPA as follows: Distinction, High Distinction, and Highest Distinction (roughly equivalent to cum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cum laude). Requisite GPAs for University honors change each year. In 2016-2017 they were: Distinction: 3.724; High Distinction: 3.845; Highest Distinction: 3.947.</span></p>
<p><strong>Maybelle M. Toombs Awards </strong>recognize the potential talent and ability of students based upon their record in the major up to the beginning of the senior year. By that time, the students must have completed at least two semesters of coursework as a History of Art major at Berkeley. Criteria for the award are outstanding grade point average and receiving financial aid. The award carries a stipend payable in the student's senior year for research and travel.</p>
<p>For the <strong>Departmental Citation</strong>, presented at Commencement to a graduating senior, the Departmental Award Committee considers grades to be the principal criterion, but it also takes into account the character of the student's overall program, its ambition and depth; the student's ability to sustain a high level of excellence throughout his or her undergraduate work, from the freshman to the senior year, in the Art History Department as well as in other subjects; and the ways in which this broad experience is brought to bear in an honors thesis of high quality, one that notably demonstrates the ability to do research in the discipline and a genuine independence of mind and maturity of judgment.</p>
<h3>Brochures, Announcements, and Files </h3>
<p>Announcements and brochures on graduate study, internships, work experience, fellowships, study abroad, training programs, and special lectures and symposia are posted on the departmental bulletin board or distributed by email. If you are interested in a particular program and need more information, please contact the undergraduate student services adviser.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Association</h3>
<p>The History of Art Undergraduate Student Association (H.Art) is an official campus group that exists to serve the interests of the department's majors. In the past, the association has compiled an internship directory, hosted a student-faculty brunch, sponsored special lunchtime talks with faculty and graduate students, and assisted in organizing career seminars. All majors are invited and encouraged to participate in the association. If you would like more information please leave a message in the association's mailbox in 416 Doe or speak with the undergraduate student services adviser. </p>

This course will attempt to situate works of art into long, general trends in art practice of the Western tradition, though it will prioritize sustained focus on single case-studies which punctuate the five centuries of art for which this course offers a historical account; attention will also gather around particular representative</span><span class="deschide"> artists’ careers. We’ll explore how the fine arts can be considered as part of wider visual culture(s) in the Western tradition, and the ways art within such a broad tradition can function both as a stabilizing and as a transformative force within social/political/religious/racial/etc contexts.</span><br/>

This course introduces students to the rich museum culture of London. Through lectures, seminars, and visits to museums we will explore how museums create histories of art, society, and national identity. The course draws on the approaches of several disciplines–art, social, and cultural history, anthropology, social geography, and critical theory–to interrogate the ways that museums reflect and shape what we know and how we see. Exploring a selection of</span><span class="deschide"> sites dating from the 18th century to the present day, we will consider the historical context in which these museums came about, the nature of their collections, and debates on current presentation, considering issues of museology, curatorial practice, and the construction of knowledge.</span><br/>

It tracks the expression of theories of beauty and truth in great works of art and architecture, spanning from the seventh century CE to the present day, and including sites across the Middle East, Asia, North Africa, East Africa, Europe, and the United States.

Rather than follow a master chronology that would attempt to contain Africa’s multiple cultural formations in a single narrative, this course will introduce students to African art through an investigation of a range of aesthetic traditions and movements across sub-Saharan Africa that are meaningfully reinvigorated in contemporary artistic production and popular visual culture. Our continual return to the cultural politics of the present will provide</span><span class="deschide"> an anchor and roadmap for our inquiry; we will see contemporary visual culture as staging interventions that push at Western ideas of “primitive African tradition,” while bringing to the fore conventions that, when tracked, reveal alternative traditions legible within an art historical context.</span><br/>

The course offers an introduction to the art and architecture of South and Southeast Asia from ca. 2500 BCE to the colonial period. Proceeding in a chronological order, we will engage with key moments of artistic production in the region. We will locate art and architecture within the larger world of political economies, religion and philosophy, gender and sexuality, urbanity, and state formations to generate the depth and context required for</span><span class="deschide"> understanding South and Southeast Asia through a historical frame. Thus, we will study Buddhism and Hinduism in the early Common Era, early modern Islamic art, and encounters with Europe fueled by colonialism.

Conversion often refers to changing religions. This process can be personal or historical, involve a single individual or entire groups, such as at the moment of colonization of the Americas, when thousands of indigenous people were forcibly or willingly converted to Christianity.

Does the converter become curious about and</span><span class="deschide"> affected by the beliefs of those he tries to gain over to his religion? What implications does this have for art, technology, thought?

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>History of Art Major Program</h3>
<p>The Major in History of Art is designed to give students solid grounding in the artistic traditions, practices, and contexts that comprise historical and contemporary visuality. Equally, it introduces the discipline’s history, methods, and debates. It prepares students to do independent research, to evaluate evidence, to create coherent and sustained arguments, and to develop skills in academic writing. In a series of increasingly focused courses — lower division, upper division, seminar, and honors program — the major provides a format for students to learn how to analyze and interpret visual, material, and textual evidence from specific cultural settings and historical circumstances. Major requirements are also designed to maximize exposure to different historical periods, geographical regions, and topics while allowing flexibility for students to pursue specific interests by selecting a Focus of Study.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>To declare the major in the History of Art Department, a student must complete two courses taught in the department and receive a grade of C- or higher in each course. All subsequent courses a student wishes to apply to the major must also receive a grade of C- or higher. Once these prerequisites are met, students may formally petition to declare the major by making an appointment with an Undergraduate Adviser at any time during the fall and spring semesters. (Students in residence at UC Berkeley are strongly urged to complete all lower division requirements and one upper division course by the end of their sophomore year.) <strong>Transfer students should plan to take two History of Art courses in their first semester.</strong></p>
<p>Majors who declare early, especially in the sophomore year, enjoy several advantages:</p>
<p><span>1. A more thorough preparation for seminars and time to study more closely with several members of the faculty.</span></p>
<p>2. Greater flexibility in coordinating major requirements with College of Letters &amp; Science (L&amp;S) requirements and in planning a sequence of courses that allows for special courses or programs of study, e.g., study abroad, curatorial internships, independent study, a double-major, and the honors program.</p>
<p>3. Time for a generally higher level of study in the senior year, and opportunity to experiment with and prepare for diverse career opportunities.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with at least a 3.7 grade point average (GPA) in the History of Art major are eligible for admission into the honors program. Candidates for honors in History of Art are required to complete satisfactorily, within their senior year, an honors thesis consisting of at least two semesters of continuing academic work under faculty supervision (usually a seminar, directed research, or independent study course in the first semester plus, in the second semester, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20H195" title="HISTART H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART H195');">HISTART H195</a></span>). Those who have completed the program will graduate with honors, high honors, or highest honors in the major depending upon their final GPA in all upper division courses taken to fulfill the major requirements. Please see the department's <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-major-requirements/honors-thesis/">honors program webpage</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The minor program in the History of Art Department is designed to provide a structured and broad program for those students majoring in other disciplines but with a strong interest in the history of art. For information regarding declaring the minor, please contact the department.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

<h4>I. Lower Division Requirements (4 courses)</h4>
<h5>A. Three History of Art Courses (9-12 units)</h5>
<p>Majors must complete 9 to 12 units of lower division course work in the History of Art Department. These units may come from courses taken in the department, courses taken at other institutions granted transfer credit for the major by the department, or from AP Art History (score of 4 or 5). Courses that qualify for lower division requirements include:</p>
<p>4 unit lecture courses: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2010" title="HISTART 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 10');">HISTART 10</a></span> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2011" title="HISTART 11" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 11');">HISTART 11</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2034" title="HISTART 34" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 34');">HISTART 34</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2035" title="HISTART 35" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 35');">HISTART 35</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2051" title="HISTART 51" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 51');">HISTART 51</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%2062" title="HISTART 62" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 62');">HISTART 62</a></span>, etc.<br/>
3 unit lecture courses.</p>

<p>Additional requirement: These three courses must include one course in Western art and one course in non-Western art.</p>
<h5>B. One Art Practice/Materials Course (2-4 units)</h5>
<p>Students must complete 2, 3, or 4 units in a course that introduces specific art making practices and/or the study of the materials of art. This course must be approved in advance by an undergraduate adviser in the History of Art Department. It may be taken P/NP. Applicable courses are typically offered in the Practice of Art Department, College of Environmental Design, and program in New Media Studies. Students may also take courses that involve the making of art occasionally taught in the department.</p>
<h4>II. Upper Division Requirements (7 or 8 courses)</h4>
<p>In their upper division coursework in History of Art (total 26-28 units; 8 of these units in seminars), each student must take courses in four of the following five geographical areas and one course in each of the chronological periods.</p>
<h5>Geographical: </h5>
<ol>
	<li>Europe and the Mediterranean </li>
	<li>Asia and the Pacific </li>
	<li>The Americas </li>
	<li>Middle East and Africa</li>
	<li>Transcultural</li>
</ol>
<h5>Chronological:</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Prehistoric-1200</li>
	<li>1200-1800</li>
	<li>1800-present</li>
</ol>
<p>Upper division lecture courses (3 or 4 units) and seminars (2 or 4 units) may fulfill these breadth requirements. Upper division classes (lecture or seminar) can fulfill both a geographical requirement and a chronological requirement.</p>
<h5>A. Five Lecture Courses (18-20 units)</h5>
<p>Up to two of these courses may be 3 unit courses.</p>
<h5>B. Seminars (8 units)</h5>
<p>Students in the major are required to complete 8 units of seminar study, of which 4 units (incorporating a research paper component) must be in their Focus of Study. The remaining 4 units may be taken as follows:</p>
<p>A second 4-unit seminar with research paper.</p>
<p><strong>Or</strong></p>
<p>Two 2-unit seminars without research papers. Individual faculty members will decide when a given seminar can be taken for 2 units. Two-unit seminars require active participation and completion of weekly readings and writing assignments. Four-unit seminars add a final research paper.</p>
<h4>III. Additional Requirements (1 or 2 courses)</h4>
<h5>A. Theories/Methods Course (4 units)</h5>
<p>All students in the major are required to take either <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20100" title="HISTART 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 100');">HISTART 100</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20101" title="HISTART 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 101');">HISTART 101</a></span>. These courses, offered in fall and spring semesters, focus on historiography and theoretical/philosophical models in the History of Art, on practical methods of art historical inquiry, or a combination thereof.

			<div id="advisingtextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><h3>Department Advising</h3>
<p>Declared majors must see an undergraduate adviser at least once each semester during the registration period (advisers are listed on the department website). These advising meetings provide majors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty member who can help them develop an overall program of study well-suited to individual strengths and career goals. The advisers also apprise majors of special courses and opportunities, both in the History of Art Department and elsewhere. Please note that faculty advisers are typically not available during the summer and winter breaks. Advising appointments can be made by signing up <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-welcome/" target="_blank">online.</a></p>
<p>In addition to general advising and coursework approval, advisers must approve all changes in registration, including withdrawals and add-drop changes, certain special study courses  (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20193" title="HISTART 193" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 193');">HISTART 193</a> Directed Research</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20194" title="HISTART 194" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 194');">HISTART 194</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20H195" title="HISTART H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART H195');">HISTART H195</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20C196W" title="HISTART C196W" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART C196W');">HISTART C196W</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20199" title="HISTART 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 199');">HISTART 199</a></span>), and some special programs. Appointments should be made well in advance of deadlines.</p>

<p>Each semester during the course enrollment period History of Art majors must see the undergraduate major adviser to discuss their program of study to release their advisor hold in order to gain access to the course enrollment system. Students should sign up for an advising appointment prior to their enrollment phase, having considered carefully the department’s course descriptions and having planned a schedule of proposed courses to be discussed with the adviser. Special additional office hours are held during enrollment periods, and advisers may decline to provide last-minute advising. Adviser holds will only be released over the phone or via email if a student is studying abroad or is physically incapacitated.</p>
<p>Department undergraduate advisers do not administer or approve coursework or degree requirements in the College of Letters &amp; Science other than the requirements of the major. For L&amp;S requirements, students should make an appointment to see an L&amp;S adviser in 206 Evans Hall.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for All Majors</h3>
<p>Foreign languages are not required in lower or upper division courses but a reading knowledge of European or Asian languages may be helpful in seminars and other research courses. Students planning on graduate study in the History of Art are urged to develop a reading knowledge of German and French or Italian as early as possible. Special language requirements pertain for graduate study in ancient and Asian art.</p>
<p>Recommended course load in History of Art will vary according to the student, course level, and individual course requirements. In general, no more than two History of Art courses per semester are recommended. A student’s final academic year may include a greater number of courses in History of Art, especially if all L&amp;S breadth requirements have been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Special programs, such as study abroad, internships, and double majoring require considerable advance planning. If you are interested in any of these, discuss your plans early with your adviser. Courses taken through study abroad must be discussed in advance with an adviser and will not be formally approved until after completion and until satisfactory documentation has been submitted. In order for courses taken abroad to satisfy major requirements, the breadth and depth of the course, the work demanded, and your performance must all meet Berkeley upper division standards. Your performance will be evaluated by a faculty adviser upon your return to campus to determine whether major requirements have been satisfied. Please see the department Study Abroad Information sheet.</p>
<p>Students with special intellectual or preprofessional interests may wish to enroll in independent study or research courses (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20193" title="HISTART 193" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 193');">HISTART 193</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20199" title="HISTART 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 199');">HISTART 199</a></span>), in a second seminar (192), or in additional, related courses in other departments. These students should discuss their interests with their advisers as early as possible.</p>

<h3>Letters of Recommendation</h3>
<p>Students should plan to request letters of recommendation from those faculty members with whom they have studied most closely, especially in seminars and other special study courses. General letters of reference for employment, internships, or graduate school/professional programs, may be placed on file with the <a href="https://career.berkeley.edu/Letter/Letter" target="_blank">Career Center</a> (2440 Bancroft Way).</p>
<h3>Graduate Study </h3>
<p>Students who anticipate applying to graduate schools should discuss their plans with their adviser or with the faculty member whose field most closely corresponds to their interests. If you plan to begin graduate study in the fall after your graduation from Berkeley, you will have to prepare applications in the fall of your senior year. Most schools have deadlines in December though February, especially if the application is made for both admission and fellowship support. Arrangements should also be made in the fall of your senior year for taking the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) or other graduate entrance exams that many schools require.</p>

			<div id="academicopportunitiestextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Department and University Honors</h3>
<p><strong>Honors in Art History</strong>: Students with a 3.7 GPA in the major may complete and submit an honors thesis by enrolling in HA195 (4 units, graded). A student whose thesis receives a grade of A- or better will receive Departmental Honors (Honors, High Honors, or Highest Honors). The Honors Thesis is a two-semester project conducted under faculty supervision, as follows: a seminar, upper division lecture, directed research, or independent study course in the first semester, followed by HA195 in the second. For specific details regarding the Honors Program, students should speak with a faculty undergraduate advisor and read the <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-major-requirements/honors-thesis/">Guidelines for the Preparation of Theses</a>.</p>
<p><strong>University honors</strong><span> are awarded to students on the basis of overall GPA as follows: Distinction, High Distinction, and Highest Distinction (roughly equivalent to cum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cum laude). Requisite GPAs for University honors change each year. In 2016-2017 they were: Distinction: 3.724; High Distinction: 3.845; Highest Distinction: 3.947.</span></p>
<p><strong>Maybelle M. Toombs Awards </strong>recognize the potential talent and ability of students based upon their record in the major up to the beginning of the senior year. By that time, the students must have completed at least two semesters of coursework as a History of Art major at Berkeley. Criteria for the award are outstanding grade point average and receiving financial aid. The award carries a stipend payable in the student's senior year for research and travel.</p>
<p>For the <strong>Departmental Citation</strong>, presented at Commencement to a graduating senior, the Departmental Award Committee considers grades to be the principal criterion, but it also takes into account the character of the student's overall program, its ambition and depth; the student's ability to sustain a high level of excellence throughout his or her undergraduate work, from the freshman to the senior year, in the Art History Department as well as in other subjects; and the ways in which this broad experience is brought to bear in an honors thesis of high quality, one that notably demonstrates the ability to do research in the discipline and a genuine independence of mind and maturity of judgment.</p>
<h3>Brochures, Announcements, and Files </h3>
<p>Announcements and brochures on graduate study, internships, work experience, fellowships, study abroad, training programs, and special lectures and symposia are posted on the departmental bulletin board or distributed by email. If you are interested in a particular program and need more information, please contact the undergraduate student services adviser.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Association</h3>
<p>The History of Art Undergraduate Student Association (H.Art) is an official campus group that exists to serve the interests of the department's majors. In the past, the association has compiled an internship directory, hosted a student-faculty brunch, sponsored special lunchtime talks with faculty and graduate students, and assisted in organizing career seminars. All majors are invited and encouraged to participate in the association. If you would like more information please leave a message in the association's mailbox in 416 Doe or speak with the undergraduate student services adviser. </p>

This course introduces students to the rich museum culture of London. Through lectures, seminars, and visits to museums we will explore how museums create histories of art, society, and national identity. The course draws on the approaches of several disciplines–art, social, and cultural history, anthropology, social geography, and critical theory–to interrogate the ways that museums reflect and shape what we know and how we see. Exploring a selection of</span><span class="deschide"> sites dating from the 18th century to the present day, we will consider the historical context in which these museums came about, the nature of their collections, and debates on current presentation, considering issues of museology, curatorial practice, and the construction of knowledge.</span><br/>

Rather than follow a master chronology that would attempt to contain Africa’s multiple cultural formations in a single narrative, this course will introduce students to African art through an investigation of a range of aesthetic traditions and movements across sub-Saharan Africa that are meaningfully reinvigorated in contemporary artistic production and popular visual culture. Our continual return to the cultural politics of the present will provide</span><span class="deschide"> an anchor and roadmap for our inquiry; we will see contemporary visual culture as staging interventions that push at Western ideas of “primitive African tradition,” while bringing to the fore conventions that, when tracked, reveal alternative traditions legible within an art historical context.</span><br/>

We will locate art and architecture within the larger world of political economies, religion and philosophy, gender and sexuality, urbanity, and state formations to generate the depth and context required for</span><span class="deschide"> understanding South and Southeast Asia through a historical frame. Thus, we will study Buddhism and Hinduism in the early Common Era, early modern Islamic art, and encounters with Europe fueled by colonialism.

Conversion often refers to changing religions. This process can be personal or historical, involve a single individual or entire groups, such as at the moment of colonization of the Americas, when thousands of indigenous people were forcibly or willingly converted to Christianity.

Does the converter become curious about and</span><span class="deschide"> affected by the beliefs of those he tries to gain over to his religion? What implications does this have for art, technology, thought?

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>History of Art Major Program</h3>
<p>The Major in History of Art is designed to give students solid grounding in the artistic traditions, practices, and contexts that comprise historical and contemporary visuality. Equally, it introduces the discipline’s history, methods, and debates. It prepares students to do independent research, to evaluate evidence, to create coherent and sustained arguments, and to develop skills in academic writing. In a series of increasingly focused courses — lower division, upper division, seminar, and honors program — the major provides a format for students to learn how to analyze and interpret visual, material, and textual evidence from specific cultural settings and historical circumstances. Major requirements are also designed to maximize exposure to different historical periods, geographical regions, and topics while allowing flexibility for students to pursue specific interests by selecting a Focus of Study.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>To declare the major in the History of Art Department, a student must complete two courses taught in the department and receive a grade of C- or higher in each course. All subsequent courses a student wishes to apply to the major must also receive a grade of C- or higher. Once these prerequisites are met, students may formally petition to declare the major by making an appointment with an Undergraduate Adviser at any time during the fall and spring semesters. (Students in residence at UC Berkeley are strongly urged to complete all lower division requirements and one upper division course by the end of their sophomore year.) <strong>Transfer students should plan to take two History of Art courses in their first semester.</strong></p>
<p>Majors who declare early, especially in the sophomore year, enjoy several advantages:</p>
<p><span>1. A more thorough preparation for seminars and time to study more closely with several members of the faculty.</span></p>
<p>2. Greater flexibility in coordinating major requirements with College of Letters &amp; Science (L&amp;S) requirements and in planning a sequence of courses that allows for special courses or programs of study, e.g., study abroad, curatorial internships, independent study, a double-major, and the honors program.</p>
<p>3. Time for a generally higher level of study in the senior year, and opportunity to experiment with and prepare for diverse career opportunities.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with at least a 3.7 grade point average (GPA) in the History of Art major are eligible for admission into the honors program. Candidates for honors in History of Art are required to complete satisfactorily, within their senior year, an honors thesis consisting of at least two semesters of continuing academic work under faculty supervision (usually a seminar, directed research, or independent study course in the first semester plus, in the second semester, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20H195" title="HISTART H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART H195');">HISTART H195</a></span>). Those who have completed the program will graduate with honors, high honors, or highest honors in the major depending upon their final GPA in all upper division courses taken to fulfill the major requirements. Please see the department's <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-major-requirements/honors-thesis/">honors program webpage</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The minor program in the History of Art Department is designed to provide a structured and broad program for those students majoring in other disciplines but with a strong interest in the history of art. For information regarding declaring the minor, please contact the department.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

3 unit lecture courses.</p>

<p>Additional requirement: These three courses must include one course in Western art and one course in non-Western art.</p>
<h5>B. One Art Practice/Materials Course (2-4 units)</h5>
<p>Students must complete 2, 3, or 4 units in a course that introduces specific art making practices and/or the study of the materials of art. This course must be approved in advance by an undergraduate adviser in the History of Art Department. It may be taken P/NP. Applicable courses are typically offered in the Practice of Art Department, College of Environmental Design, and program in New Media Studies. Students may also take courses that involve the making of art occasionally taught in the department.</p>
<h4>II. Upper Division Requirements (7 or 8 courses)</h4>
<p>In their upper division coursework in History of Art (total 26-28 units; 8 of these units in seminars), each student must take courses in four of the following five geographical areas and one course in each of the chronological periods.</p>
<h5>Geographical: </h5>
<ol>
	<li>Europe and the Mediterranean </li>
	<li>Asia and the Pacific </li>
	<li>The Americas </li>
	<li>Middle East and Africa</li>

				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><h3>Department Advising</h3>
<p>Declared majors must see an undergraduate adviser at least once each semester during the registration period (advisers are listed on the department website). These advising meetings provide majors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty member who can help them develop an overall program of study well-suited to individual strengths and career goals. The advisers also apprise majors of special courses and opportunities, both in the History of Art Department and elsewhere. Please note that faculty advisers are typically not available during the summer and winter breaks. Advising appointments can be made by signing up <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-welcome/" target="_blank">online.</a></p>
<p>In addition to general advising and coursework approval, advisers must approve all changes in registration, including withdrawals and add-drop changes, certain special study courses  (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20193" title="HISTART 193" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 193');">HISTART 193</a> Directed Research</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20194" title="HISTART 194" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 194');">HISTART 194</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20H195" title="HISTART H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART H195');">HISTART H195</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20C196W" title="HISTART C196W" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART C196W');">HISTART C196W</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20199" title="HISTART 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 199');">HISTART 199</a></span>), and some special programs. Appointments should be made well in advance of deadlines.</p>

<p>Each semester during the course enrollment period History of Art majors must see the undergraduate major adviser to discuss their program of study to release their advisor hold in order to gain access to the course enrollment system. Students should sign up for an advising appointment prior to their enrollment phase, having considered carefully the department’s course descriptions and having planned a schedule of proposed courses to be discussed with the adviser. Special additional office hours are held during enrollment periods, and advisers may decline to provide last-minute advising. Adviser holds will only be released over the phone or via email if a student is studying abroad or is physically incapacitated.</p>
<p>Department undergraduate advisers do not administer or approve coursework or degree requirements in the College of Letters &amp; Science other than the requirements of the major. For L&amp;S requirements, students should make an appointment to see an L&amp;S adviser in 206 Evans Hall.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for All Majors</h3>
<p>Foreign languages are not required in lower or upper division courses but a reading knowledge of European or Asian languages may be helpful in seminars and other research courses. Students planning on graduate study in the History of Art are urged to develop a reading knowledge of German and French or Italian as early as possible. Special language requirements pertain for graduate study in ancient and Asian art.</p>
<p>Recommended course load in History of Art will vary according to the student, course level, and individual course requirements. In general, no more than two History of Art courses per semester are recommended. A student’s final academic year may include a greater number of courses in History of Art, especially if all L&amp;S breadth requirements have been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Special programs, such as study abroad, internships, and double majoring require considerable advance planning. If you are interested in any of these, discuss your plans early with your adviser. Courses taken through study abroad must be discussed in advance with an adviser and will not be formally approved until after completion and until satisfactory documentation has been submitted. In order for courses taken abroad to satisfy major requirements, the breadth and depth of the course, the work demanded, and your performance must all meet Berkeley upper division standards. Your performance will be evaluated by a faculty adviser upon your return to campus to determine whether major requirements have been satisfied. Please see the department Study Abroad Information sheet.</p>
<p>Students with special intellectual or preprofessional interests may wish to enroll in independent study or research courses (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20193" title="HISTART 193" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 193');">HISTART 193</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20199" title="HISTART 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 199');">HISTART 199</a></span>), in a second seminar (192), or in additional, related courses in other departments. These students should discuss their interests with their advisers as early as possible.</p>

<h3>Letters of Recommendation</h3>
<p>Students should plan to request letters of recommendation from those faculty members with whom they have studied most closely, especially in seminars and other special study courses. General letters of reference for employment, internships, or graduate school/professional programs, may be placed on file with the <a href="https://career.berkeley.edu/Letter/Letter" target="_blank">Career Center</a> (2440 Bancroft Way).</p>
<h3>Graduate Study </h3>
<p>Students who anticipate applying to graduate schools should discuss their plans with their adviser or with the faculty member whose field most closely corresponds to their interests. If you plan to begin graduate study in the fall after your graduation from Berkeley, you will have to prepare applications in the fall of your senior year. Most schools have deadlines in December though February, especially if the application is made for both admission and fellowship support. Arrangements should also be made in the fall of your senior year for taking the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) or other graduate entrance exams that many schools require.</p>

				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Department and University Honors</h3>
<p><strong>Honors in Art History</strong>: Students with a 3.7 GPA in the major may complete and submit an honors thesis by enrolling in HA195 (4 units, graded). A student whose thesis receives a grade of A- or better will receive Departmental Honors (Honors, High Honors, or Highest Honors). The Honors Thesis is a two-semester project conducted under faculty supervision, as follows: a seminar, upper division lecture, directed research, or independent study course in the first semester, followed by HA195 in the second. For specific details regarding the Honors Program, students should speak with a faculty undergraduate advisor and read the <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-major-requirements/honors-thesis/">Guidelines for the Preparation of Theses</a>.</p>
<p><strong>University honors</strong><span> are awarded to students on the basis of overall GPA as follows: Distinction, High Distinction, and Highest Distinction (roughly equivalent to cum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cum laude). Requisite GPAs for University honors change each year. In 2016-2017 they were: Distinction: 3.724; High Distinction: 3.845; Highest Distinction: 3.947.</span></p>
<p><strong>Maybelle M. Toombs Awards </strong>recognize the potential talent and ability of students based upon their record in the major up to the beginning of the senior year. By that time, the students must have completed at least two semesters of coursework as a History of Art major at Berkeley. Criteria for the award are outstanding grade point average and receiving financial aid. The award carries a stipend payable in the student's senior year for research and travel.</p>
<p>For the <strong>Departmental Citation</strong>, presented at Commencement to a graduating senior, the Departmental Award Committee considers grades to be the principal criterion, but it also takes into account the character of the student's overall program, its ambition and depth; the student's ability to sustain a high level of excellence throughout his or her undergraduate work, from the freshman to the senior year, in the Art History Department as well as in other subjects; and the ways in which this broad experience is brought to bear in an honors thesis of high quality, one that notably demonstrates the ability to do research in the discipline and a genuine independence of mind and maturity of judgment.</p>
<h3>Brochures, Announcements, and Files </h3>
<p>Announcements and brochures on graduate study, internships, work experience, fellowships, study abroad, training programs, and special lectures and symposia are posted on the departmental bulletin board or distributed by email. If you are interested in a particular program and need more information, please contact the undergraduate student services adviser.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Association</h3>
<p>The History of Art Undergraduate Student Association (H.Art) is an official campus group that exists to serve the interests of the department's majors. In the past, the association has compiled an internship directory, hosted a student-faculty brunch, sponsored special lunchtime talks with faculty and graduate students, and assisted in organizing career seminars. All majors are invited and encouraged to participate in the association. If you would like more information please leave a message in the association's mailbox in 416 Doe or speak with the undergraduate student services adviser. </p>

This course introduces students to the rich museum culture of London. Through lectures, seminars, and visits to museums we will explore how museums create histories of art, society, and national identity. The course draws on the approaches of several disciplines–art, social, and cultural history, anthropology, social geography, and critical theory–to interrogate the ways that museums reflect and shape what we know and how we see. Exploring a selection of</span><span class="deschide"> sites dating from the 18th century to the present day, we will consider the historical context in which these museums came about, the nature of their collections, and debates on current presentation, considering issues of museology, curatorial practice, and the construction of knowledge.</span><br/>

This course is an exercise in thinking about human perception and knowing in relation to the history of Islamic art and visual culture. It tracks the expression of theories of beauty and truth in great works of art and architecture, spanning from the seventh century CE to the present day, and including sites across the Middle East, Asia, North Africa, East Africa, Europe, and the United States. Equally, it aims to examine our own contemporary habits of</span><span class="deschide"> assessing beauty and truth, and their fit (or lack thereof) when confronted with an amazing diversity of art, made in distinct historical conditions of belief, interpretation and education, patronage, production, circulation, gender and sexuality, displacement and migration, and more.<br/></span><br/>

Rather than follow a master chronology that would attempt to contain Africa’s multiple cultural formations in a single narrative, this course will introduce students to African art through an investigation of a range of aesthetic traditions and movements across sub-Saharan Africa that are meaningfully reinvigorated in contemporary artistic production and popular visual culture. Our continual return to the cultural politics of the present will provide</span><span class="deschide"> an anchor and roadmap for our inquiry; we will see contemporary visual culture as staging interventions that push at Western ideas of “primitive African tradition,” while bringing to the fore conventions that, when tracked, reveal alternative traditions legible within an art historical context.</span><br/>

The course offers an introduction to the art and architecture of South and Southeast Asia from ca. 2500 BCE to the colonial period. Proceeding in a chronological order, we will engage with key moments of artistic production in the region. We will locate art and architecture within the larger world of political economies, religion and philosophy, gender and sexuality, urbanity, and state formations to generate the depth and context required for</span><span class="deschide"> understanding South and Southeast Asia through a historical frame. Thus, we will study Buddhism and Hinduism in the early Common Era, early modern Islamic art, and encounters with Europe fueled by colonialism.

An introduction to the arts and visual culture of Latin America from the earliest monumental art traditions of prehistory to the present. The course is not a comprehensive survey of all traditions of art in Latin America, but rather a sampling of critical moments that is designed to serve as an introduction to this field of study. We will take a long view of enduring traditions as well as periods of rupture and crisis. Lecture and discussion will frequently</span><span class="deschide"> center on the active roles of the arts in society, religion, and politics from the earliest Pre-Columbian settings to the present day. No prior knowledge of Latin American art history is expected. This course is designed for both majors and non-majors in the humanities and sciences.</span><br/>

A historical introduction to digital images. This class explores how computers store, process, and display visual information, and the cultural impact that these technologies have had since the dawn of the computer age. Special attention will be given to the ways in which this information differs from direct inputs to the human visual system--that is, how digital images differ from “what we really see”, as well as the differences between modern computer graphics</span><span class="deschide"> techniques and prior analog notational systems. Basic computational literacy will be developed during coding assignments in section; students will learn how to transform and edit their own images.</span><br/>

Conversion often refers to changing religions. This process can be personal or historical, involve a single individual or entire groups, such as at the moment of colonization of the Americas, when thousands of indigenous people were forcibly or willingly converted to Christianity. But what does it mean to convert? Is it a one-time event by which change gets effected and is final, or, does it involve multiple negotiations? Does the converter become curious about and</span><span class="deschide"> affected by the beliefs of those he tries to gain over to his religion? What implications does this have for art, technology, thought? We will look at how this concept gets represented in different media and divergent forms of literacy: textual, pictorial, ritual.</span><br/>

In addition to painting, sculpture, and photography, we will also examine video, performance, and intermedia art.

Under the violence of dictatorial regimes, social repression, and foreign intervention, artists across Latin America have turned to art and craft practices to protest and give visibility to the injustices plaguing their communities. In light of recent scholarship and exhibitions that have recently focused on the political and social climate in Latin America during the late twentieth century, this course surveys the ways in which art functioned</span><span class="deschide"> as a form of resistance, critique, and empowerment during the 1960s through the 1990s.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>History of Art Major Program</h3>
<p>The Major in History of Art is designed to give students solid grounding in the artistic traditions, practices, and contexts that comprise historical and contemporary visuality. Equally, it introduces the discipline’s history, methods, and debates. It prepares students to do independent research, to evaluate evidence, to create coherent and sustained arguments, and to develop skills in academic writing. In a series of increasingly focused courses — lower division, upper division, seminar, and honors program — the major provides a format for students to learn how to analyze and interpret visual, material, and textual evidence from specific cultural settings and historical circumstances. Major requirements are also designed to maximize exposure to different historical periods, geographical regions, and topics while allowing flexibility for students to pursue specific interests by selecting a Focus of Study.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>To declare the major in the History of Art Department, a student must complete two courses taught in the department and receive a grade of C- or higher in each course. All subsequent courses a student wishes to apply to the major must also receive a grade of C- or higher. Once these prerequisites are met, students may formally petition to declare the major by making an appointment with an Undergraduate Adviser at any time during the fall and spring semesters. (Students in residence at UC Berkeley are strongly urged to complete all lower division requirements and one upper division course by the end of their sophomore year.) <strong>Transfer students should plan to take two History of Art courses in their first semester.</strong></p>
<p>Majors who declare early, especially in the sophomore year, enjoy several advantages:</p>
<p><span>1. A more thorough preparation for seminars and time to study more closely with several members of the faculty.</span></p>
<p>2. Greater flexibility in coordinating major requirements with College of Letters &amp; Science (L&amp;S) requirements and in planning a sequence of courses that allows for special courses or programs of study, e.g., study abroad, curatorial internships, independent study, a double-major, and the honors program.</p>
<p>3. Time for a generally higher level of study in the senior year, and opportunity to experiment with and prepare for diverse career opportunities.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with at least a 3.7 grade point average (GPA) in the History of Art major are eligible for admission into the honors program. Candidates for honors in History of Art are required to complete satisfactorily, within their senior year, an honors thesis consisting of at least two semesters of continuing academic work under faculty supervision (usually a seminar, directed research, or independent study course in the first semester plus, in the second semester, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20H195" title="HISTART H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART H195');">HISTART H195</a></span>). Those who have completed the program will graduate with honors, high honors, or highest honors in the major depending upon their final GPA in all upper division courses taken to fulfill the major requirements. Please see the department's <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-major-requirements/honors-thesis/">honors program webpage</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The minor program in the History of Art Department is designed to provide a structured and broad program for those students majoring in other disciplines but with a strong interest in the history of art. For information regarding declaring the minor, please contact the department.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><h3>Department Advising</h3>
<p>Declared majors must see an undergraduate adviser at least once each semester during the registration period (advisers are listed on the department website). These advising meetings provide majors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty member who can help them develop an overall program of study well-suited to individual strengths and career goals. The advisers also apprise majors of special courses and opportunities, both in the History of Art Department and elsewhere. Please note that faculty advisers are typically not available during the summer and winter breaks. Advising appointments can be made by signing up <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-welcome/" target="_blank">online.</a></p>
<p>In addition to general advising and coursework approval, advisers must approve all changes in registration, including withdrawals and add-drop changes, certain special study courses  (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20193" title="HISTART 193" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 193');">HISTART 193</a> Directed Research</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20194" title="HISTART 194" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 194');">HISTART 194</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20H195" title="HISTART H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART H195');">HISTART H195</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20C196W" title="HISTART C196W" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART C196W');">HISTART C196W</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20199" title="HISTART 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 199');">HISTART 199</a></span>), and some special programs. Appointments should be made well in advance of deadlines.</p>

<p>Each semester during the course enrollment period History of Art majors must see the undergraduate major adviser to discuss their program of study to release their advisor hold in order to gain access to the course enrollment system. Students should sign up for an advising appointment prior to their enrollment phase, having considered carefully the department’s course descriptions and having planned a schedule of proposed courses to be discussed with the adviser. Special additional office hours are held during enrollment periods, and advisers may decline to provide last-minute advising. Adviser holds will only be released over the phone or via email if a student is studying abroad or is physically incapacitated.</p>
<p>Department undergraduate advisers do not administer or approve coursework or degree requirements in the College of Letters &amp; Science other than the requirements of the major. For L&amp;S requirements, students should make an appointment to see an L&amp;S adviser in 206 Evans Hall.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for All Majors</h3>
<p>Foreign languages are not required in lower or upper division courses but a reading knowledge of European or Asian languages may be helpful in seminars and other research courses. Students planning on graduate study in the History of Art are urged to develop a reading knowledge of German and French or Italian as early as possible. Special language requirements pertain for graduate study in ancient and Asian art.</p>
<p>Recommended course load in History of Art will vary according to the student, course level, and individual course requirements. In general, no more than two History of Art courses per semester are recommended. A student’s final academic year may include a greater number of courses in History of Art, especially if all L&amp;S breadth requirements have been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Special programs, such as study abroad, internships, and double majoring require considerable advance planning. If you are interested in any of these, discuss your plans early with your adviser. Courses taken through study abroad must be discussed in advance with an adviser and will not be formally approved until after completion and until satisfactory documentation has been submitted. In order for courses taken abroad to satisfy major requirements, the breadth and depth of the course, the work demanded, and your performance must all meet Berkeley upper division standards. Your performance will be evaluated by a faculty adviser upon your return to campus to determine whether major requirements have been satisfied. Please see the department Study Abroad Information sheet.</p>
<p>Students with special intellectual or preprofessional interests may wish to enroll in independent study or research courses (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20193" title="HISTART 193" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 193');">HISTART 193</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTART%20199" title="HISTART 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTART 199');">HISTART 199</a></span>), in a second seminar (192), or in additional, related courses in other departments. These students should discuss their interests with their advisers as early as possible.</p>

<h3>Letters of Recommendation</h3>
<p>Students should plan to request letters of recommendation from those faculty members with whom they have studied most closely, especially in seminars and other special study courses. General letters of reference for employment, internships, or graduate school/professional programs, may be placed on file with the <a href="https://career.berkeley.edu/Letter/Letter" target="_blank">Career Center</a> (2440 Bancroft Way).</p>
<h3>Graduate Study </h3>
<p>Students who anticipate applying to graduate schools should discuss their plans with their adviser or with the faculty member whose field most closely corresponds to their interests. If you plan to begin graduate study in the fall after your graduation from Berkeley, you will have to prepare applications in the fall of your senior year. Most schools have deadlines in December though February, especially if the application is made for both admission and fellowship support. Arrangements should also be made in the fall of your senior year for taking the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) or other graduate entrance exams that many schools require.</p>

				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Department and University Honors</h3>
<p><strong>Honors in Art History</strong>: Students with a 3.7 GPA in the major may complete and submit an honors thesis by enrolling in HA195 (4 units, graded). A student whose thesis receives a grade of A- or better will receive Departmental Honors (Honors, High Honors, or Highest Honors). The Honors Thesis is a two-semester project conducted under faculty supervision, as follows: a seminar, upper division lecture, directed research, or independent study course in the first semester, followed by HA195 in the second. For specific details regarding the Honors Program, students should speak with a faculty undergraduate advisor and read the <a href="http://arthistory.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-major-requirements/honors-thesis/">Guidelines for the Preparation of Theses</a>.</p>
<p><strong>University honors</strong><span> are awarded to students on the basis of overall GPA as follows: Distinction, High Distinction, and Highest Distinction (roughly equivalent to cum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cum laude). Requisite GPAs for University honors change each year. In 2016-2017 they were: Distinction: 3.724; High Distinction: 3.845; Highest Distinction: 3.947.</span></p>
<p><strong>Maybelle M. Toombs Awards </strong>recognize the potential talent and ability of students based upon their record in the major up to the beginning of the senior year. By that time, the students must have completed at least two semesters of coursework as a History of Art major at Berkeley. Criteria for the award are outstanding grade point average and receiving financial aid. The award carries a stipend payable in the student's senior year for research and travel.</p>
<p>For the <strong>Departmental Citation</strong>, presented at Commencement to a graduating senior, the Departmental Award Committee considers grades to be the principal criterion, but it also takes into account the character of the student's overall program, its ambition and depth; the student's ability to sustain a high level of excellence throughout his or her undergraduate work, from the freshman to the senior year, in the Art History Department as well as in other subjects; and the ways in which this broad experience is brought to bear in an honors thesis of high quality, one that notably demonstrates the ability to do research in the discipline and a genuine independence of mind and maturity of judgment.</p>
<h3>Brochures, Announcements, and Files </h3>
<p>Announcements and brochures on graduate study, internships, work experience, fellowships, study abroad, training programs, and special lectures and symposia are posted on the departmental bulletin board or distributed by email. If you are interested in a particular program and need more information, please contact the undergraduate student services adviser.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Association</h3>
<p>The History of Art Undergraduate Student Association (H.Art) is an official campus group that exists to serve the interests of the department's majors. In the past, the association has compiled an internship directory, hosted a student-faculty brunch, sponsored special lunchtime talks with faculty and graduate students, and assisted in organizing career seminars. All majors are invited and encouraged to participate in the association. If you would like more information please leave a message in the association's mailbox in 416 Doe or speak with the undergraduate student services adviser. </p>

This course introduces students to the rich museum culture of London. Through lectures, seminars, and visits to museums we will explore how museums create histories of art, society, and national identity. The course draws on the approaches of several disciplines–art, social, and cultural history, anthropology, social geography, and critical theory–to interrogate the ways that museums reflect and shape what we know and how we see. Exploring a selection of</span><span class="deschide"> sites dating from the 18th century to the present day, we will consider the historical context in which these museums came about, the nature of their collections, and debates on current presentation, considering issues of museology, curatorial practice, and the construction of knowledge.</span><br/>

This course is an exercise in thinking about human perception and knowing in relation to the history of Islamic art and visual culture. It tracks the expression of theories of beauty and truth in great works of art and architecture, spanning from the seventh century CE to the present day, and including sites across the Middle East, Asia, North Africa, East Africa, Europe, and the United States. Equally, it aims to examine our own contemporary habits of</span><span class="deschide"> assessing beauty and truth, and their fit (or lack thereof) when confronted with an amazing diversity of art, made in distinct historical conditions of belief, interpretation and education, patronage, production, circulation, gender and sexuality, displacement and migration, and more.<br/></span><br/>

Rather than follow a master chronology that would attempt to contain Africa’s multiple cultural formations in a single narrative, this course will introduce students to African art through an investigation of a range of aesthetic traditions and movements across sub-Saharan Africa that are meaningfully reinvigorated in contemporary artistic production and popular visual culture. Our continual return to the cultural politics of the present will provide</span><span class="deschide"> an anchor and roadmap for our inquiry; we will see contemporary visual culture as staging interventions that push at Western ideas of “primitive African tradition,” while bringing to the fore conventions that, when tracked, reveal alternative traditions legible within an art historical context.</span><br/>

The course offers an introduction to the art and architecture of South and Southeast Asia from ca. 2500 BCE to the colonial period. Proceeding in a chronological order, we will engage with key moments of artistic production in the region. We will locate art and architecture within the larger world of political economies, religion and philosophy, gender and sexuality, urbanity, and state formations to generate the depth and context required for</span><span class="deschide"> understanding South and Southeast Asia through a historical frame. Thus, we will study Buddhism and Hinduism in the early Common Era, early modern Islamic art, and encounters with Europe fueled by colonialism.

We will take a long view of enduring traditions as well as periods of rupture and crisis. Lecture and discussion will frequently</span><span class="deschide"> center on the active roles of the arts in society, religion, and politics from the earliest Pre-Columbian settings to the present day. No prior knowledge of Latin American art history is expected. This course is designed for both majors and non-majors in the humanities and sciences.</span><br/>

A historical introduction to digital images. This class explores how computers store, process, and display visual information, and the cultural impact that these technologies have had since the dawn of the computer age. Special attention will be given to the ways in which this information differs from direct inputs to the human visual system--that is, how digital images differ from “what we really see”, as well as the differences between modern computer graphics</span><span class="deschide"> techniques and prior analog notational systems. Basic computational literacy will be developed during coding assignments in section; students will learn how to transform and edit their own images.</span><br/>

Conversion often refers to changing religions. This process can be personal or historical, involve a single individual or entire groups, such as at the moment of colonization of the Americas, when thousands of indigenous people were forcibly or willingly converted to Christianity. But what does it mean to convert? Is it a one-time event by which change gets effected and is final, or, does it involve multiple negotiations? Does the converter become curious about and</span><span class="deschide"> affected by the beliefs of those he tries to gain over to his religion?

For millions of years, hominid creatures quite like us made nothing like what we now take to be images or ornaments-&quot;art.&quot; Why not?

We will be reading a selection of Greek and Latin biographical texts (in translation) and comparing them with statuary monuments that represent the same individuals. We will be seeking to elicit the points of contact between the two commemorative</span><span class="deschide"> traditions, visual and literary, and to understand the sometimes similar functions they serve.

In this course we explore the intersections of art and science in medieval, modern, and contemporary history. Our aim is twofold. First, to explore the close interaction between these two fields, and the way in which they have shaped each other through the ages. Second, to focus our attention on specific instances of art/science interaction, using them as prisms through which one can reach a fuller understanding of major historical transformations.</span><br/>

In addition to painting, sculpture, and photography, we will also examine video, performance, and intermedia art. Of particular interest will be defining the balance of concerns demonstrated by artists during this time between form and content, abstraction</span><span class="deschide"> and representation, and the intersection of their artworks with culture at large--including issues of technology, the body, commercial economy, and public space. Along with a wide range of images, our discussions will consider theoretical and critical texts.</span><br/>

Under the violence of dictatorial regimes, social repression, and foreign intervention, artists across Latin America have turned to art and craft practices to protest and give visibility to the injustices plaguing their communities. In light of recent scholarship and exhibitions that have recently focused on the political and social climate in Latin America during the late twentieth century, this course surveys the ways in which art functioned</span><span class="deschide"> as a form of resistance, critique, and empowerment during the 1960s through the 1990s.
