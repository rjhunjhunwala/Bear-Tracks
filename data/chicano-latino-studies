				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies major offers an interdisciplinary curriculum of academic study that critically examines the historical and contemporary experiences of people of Mexican descent in the context of American society and institutions. Moreover, in light of continuous immigration from Mexico, and now Central America, the Chicano studies major curriculum includes the study of particular aspects of Mexican history, culture, and politics as they bear upon the Chicano community, past and present. <span>Emphasis is given in the major to the student developing a broad knowledge of the Chicano experience. Thus, the major stresses the analysis of the interrelationships in the historical background, cultural patterns, and artistic expressions of the Chicano community in order to acquire a well-rounded, in-depth understanding of the contemporary interface between Chicanos and American society. In this connection, the major strives to incorporate various disciplines in its approach, such as political science, sociology, anthropology, history, literary criticism, and art. </span><span>Through the interdisciplinary nature of our curriculum, the major is aimed at preparing students for incorporation into the world of work and for a wide range of advanced graduate work and/or professional training in various fields.</span></p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The Chicano Studies Program provides a program leading to the BA degree with honors. A student must have senior standing; a 3.5 GPA overall; and 3.5 GPA in the major. To complete the degree with honors, the student will be required to undertake a 6-unit research project (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=CHICANO%20H195A" title="CHICANO H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'CHICANO H195A');">CHICANO H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=CHICANO%20H195B" title="CHICANO H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'CHICANO H195B');">CHICANO H195B</a></span>) and will be graded according to standards determined by the faculty adviser as being of honors quality.</p>

For the last 30 years, the themes of identity and liberation have dominated the social ethic and religious thought of subaltern subjectivities in the Americas. The centrality of these ideas respond to the increasing awareness of and opposition to the legacies of the history of conquest, colonization, racism, and sexism in the region. In this course, we are going to study the intellectual production</span><span class="deschide"> of various ethnic groups in the Americas, particularly Latinas and Latinos in the 20th century, in order to clarify the ties between concerns for cultural and religious identity and the articulation of alternative ethical and political visions.</span><br/>

The main goal of this course is to offer a broad and comprehensive understanding of the Caribbean migration experience to the United States.
