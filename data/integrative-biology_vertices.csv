INTEGBI 177LF,1,"We will study the anatomy, physiology, life history, diversity, evolution, behavior, biogeography and ecology of the fishes, the most diverse of all vertebrate groups and the dominant group of vertebrates in aquatic habitats. Aside from serving as a comprehensive introduction to the science of ichthyology, the course will provide a solid foundation in anatomy, physiology, evolution, life history, and ecology and will prepare you well for careers in fisheries science"

INTEGBI 183L,1,"Introduction to vertebrate paleontology, focusing on the history and phylogeny of vertebrates ranging from fishes to humans. Emphasis: evolution, taxonomy, functional morphology, faunas through time, problems in vertebrate history, including diversity through time and extinction. Laboratory: vertebrate fossils, focusing on demonstration and study of problems related to taxonomy, evolution, functional morphology, structures, preservation of"
INTEGBI 184L,1,"Lectures on comparative osteology of vertebrates, with emphasis on selected groups of terrestrial vertebrates considered in paleoecological, paleoclimatological, and biostratigraphic analyses. Laboratory: comparative osteology of vertebrates, with emphasis on selected groups of vertebrates. Structure, anatomy, morphology, function, and development of the vertebrate skeleton."
INTEGBI C185L,1,Origin and relationships of the extinct forms of mankind.
INTEGBI C187,1,"This course examines the history of human dispersal across Oceania from the perspectives of biogeography and evolutionary ecology. H. sapiens faced problems of dispersal, colonization, and extinction, and adapted in a variety of ways to the diversity of insular ecosystems. A dual evolutionary model takes into account cultural evolution and transmission, as well as biological evolution of human populations. This course also explores the impacts of human"
INTEGBI 190,1,"This upper-division undergraduate course will allow students to pursue specialized topics in biology in a seminar format. The specific content of the course will vary based on the topic and the instructor. In general, weekly meetings will provide a forum for extended discussion of selected aspects of evolutionary biology. Supplementary readings and assignments will provide critical background information and keep students engaged in relevant"
INTEGBI 191,1,This course is intended for advanced undergraduates wishing to pursue independent research projects under the mentorship of an IB faculty member. Research projects will be rigorous and will provide significant training in the methods of evoluntionary research. A project proposal is required to enroll and students are expected to produce a substantial written summary of their work.
INTEGBI 194,1,"UGSI will work under supervision of instructor and/or GSI. The UGSI will attend any mandatory preparatory and review meetings, be available in the classroom (discussion or laboratory) to respond to student questions, facilitate lesson plans, perform other tasks as assigned. UGSIs do not evaluate students' work or assign grades."
INTEGBI C195,1,"This course prepares students to conduct a 10-week global health research project in a low or middle-income country (LMIC); provides a background in global health, emphasizing infectious disease research, international research ethics, and the conduct of health research in low-resource settings. Leads students through the process of preparing for, conducting, and completing a short-term research project, with modules focused on cultural communication"
