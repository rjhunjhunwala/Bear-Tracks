				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures offers three different major tracks.</p>
<h4>Russian/East European/Eurasian Cultures</h4>
<p>This track offers an interdisciplinary area studies approach. For this major track, students chose between two concentrations: Russian, or Armenian/Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian/Czech/Hungarian/Polish. Two years of study (or the equivalent) in Russian or another language are required. This major track integrates the study of languages and cultures of a large area: Russia, East Central Europe, Southeastern Europe, and Eurasia. Students design their own programs by selecting courses offered by the Slavic department and other departments such as History, Political Economy, Geography, Political Science, Peace and Conflict Studies, Anthropology, and others. While all majors in this track will gain some knowledge of the whole area, the program also allows each student to emphasize a specific cultural region, compare different regions, and/or define a particular field of study.</p>
<p>Students are advised to see the major adviser in advance to prepare an individualized study list plan.</p>
<h4>Russian Language and Literature</h4>
<p>This track focuses specifically on Russian language and literature. It requires three years of language coursework (or the equivalent). This major track integrates the study of Russian language, literature, and culture. Students will learn what defines Russia’s unique place in civilization both in earlier times and in today’s world. Students are advised to see the major adviser in advance to prepare an individualized study plan.</p>
<p><strong>Declaring the Major</strong></p>
<p>All students must see the major adviser for consultation, language proficiency referral (as needed), and study list planning and approval prior to pursuing a major track. <span>Students may declare their major upon entry to the University. However, the department encourages one year of study in the student’s major language prior to declaration.</span></p>
<h3><span>Heritage Speakers of Russian</span></h3>
<p>Heritage speakers include those who grew up in Russian speaking families or communities but without a standard Russian language educational background. Heritage speakers may select any major or minor track offered by the Department except the minor in Russian language. The requirements may change depending on each student’s language proficiency and academic interests. Consult the Major Advisor for language testing and individualized plan of study.</p>
<h3><span>Honors Program</span></h3>
<p>Slavic majors with a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 overall and in courses for the major are invited to consult with members of the faculty and the major adviser in the spring of their junior year about the honors program and a thesis topic. Requirements for the honors program in Slavic include an additional upper division Slavic course chosen by the student and an honors thesis course (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SLAVIC%20H195" title="SLAVIC H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SLAVIC H195');">SLAVIC H195</a></span><span>).</span></p>

<p>In the honors thesis course, normally taken during the fall semester of the senior year, the student will write a thesis under the direction of a member of the faculty (the thesis director). In order to enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SLAVIC%20H195" title="SLAVIC H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SLAVIC H195');">SLAVIC H195</a></span>, students must file an application with the department (available from the undergraduate student services adviser). This application includes a preliminary statement of the thesis topic and the names and signatures of the honors committee—the faculty director and one additional faculty member who also read the completed thesis—and the department chair.</p>

<h3>Minors offered by the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures</h3>
<p>The department does not offer a general minor in Slavic Languages and Literatures. Instead, the minor programs offered are specialized based on language and/or literature:<br/>

Books written for children emerge from specific and complicated social and historical contexts, as do the children (and adults) who read these books. In recent years, the world of children's books has been rocked by productive debates about the kinds of stories told and the identities of the voices telling those stories. In this class, we will read a wide assortment of books written (both long ago and very recently) for children, with particular attention paid to</span><span class="deschide"> books addressing the experiences of Native, Latinx and African American children in the United States. We will also read scholarly, critical, and theoretical articles as we engage with our texts. Assessment will be based on class participation, written papers, and exams.</span><br/>

<p>The Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures offers three different major tracks.</p>
<h4>Russian/East European/Eurasian Cultures</h4>
<p>This track offers an interdisciplinary area studies approach. For this major track, students chose between two concentrations: Russian, or Armenian/Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian/Czech/Hungarian/Polish. Two years of study (or the equivalent) in Russian or another language are required. This major track integrates the study of languages and cultures of a large area: Russia, East Central Europe, Southeastern Europe, and Eurasia. Students design their own programs by selecting courses offered by the Slavic department and other departments such as History, Political Economy, Geography, Political Science, Peace and Conflict Studies, Anthropology, and others. While all majors in this track will gain some knowledge of the whole area, the program also allows each student to emphasize a specific cultural region, compare different regions, and/or define a particular field of study.</p>
<p>Students are advised to see the major adviser in advance to prepare an individualized study list plan.</p>
<h4>Russian Language and Literature</h4>
<p>This track focuses specifically on Russian language and literature. It requires three years of language coursework (or the equivalent). This major track integrates the study of Russian language, literature, and culture. Students will learn what defines Russia’s unique place in civilization both in earlier times and in today’s world. Students are advised to see the major adviser in advance to prepare an individualized study plan.</p>
<p><strong>Declaring the Major</strong></p>
<p>All students must see the major adviser for consultation, language proficiency referral (as needed), and study list planning and approval prior to pursuing a major track. <span>Students may declare their major upon entry to the University. However, the department encourages one year of study in the student’s major language prior to declaration.</span></p>
<h3><span>Heritage Speakers of Russian</span></h3>
<p>Heritage speakers include those who grew up in Russian speaking families or communities but without a standard Russian language educational background. Heritage speakers may select any major or minor track offered by the Department except the minor in Russian language. The requirements may change depending on each student’s language proficiency and academic interests. Consult the Major Advisor for language testing and individualized plan of study.</p>
<h3><span>Honors Program</span></h3>
<p>Slavic majors with a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 overall and in courses for the major are invited to consult with members of the faculty and the major adviser in the spring of their junior year about the honors program and a thesis topic. Requirements for the honors program in Slavic include an additional upper division Slavic course chosen by the student and an honors thesis course (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SLAVIC%20H195" title="SLAVIC H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SLAVIC H195');">SLAVIC H195</a></span><span>).</span></p>

<p>In the honors thesis course, normally taken during the fall semester of the senior year, the student will write a thesis under the direction of a member of the faculty (the thesis director). In order to enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SLAVIC%20H195" title="SLAVIC H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SLAVIC H195');">SLAVIC H195</a></span>, students must file an application with the department (available from the undergraduate student services adviser). This application includes a preliminary statement of the thesis topic and the names and signatures of the honors committee—the faculty director and one additional faculty member who also read the completed thesis—and the department chair.</p>

This course offers a cultural history of encounters between Russia and Asia in literature, film and visual art. The lenses of Orientalism, Eurasianism and Internationalism will be used to analyze Russian interactions with three spaces: the Caucasus, Central Asia, and East Asia. We will discuss works by classic Russian writers and artists (including Tolstoy, Blok and Platonov) that address the question of Russia’s engagement with Asia and consider Russia’s ambiguous</span><span class="deschide"> spatial identity between Europe and Asia. We will also examine responses to Russian culture and the Russian/Soviet state in the literature and culture of China (Lu Xun, Xiao Hong), Japan (Kurosawa), Central Asia (Aitmatov) and the Caucasus (Sadulaev). All readings in English.</span><br/>

This course explores the literary and visual culture that emerged in post-Soviet societies following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures offers three different major tracks.</p>
<h4>Russian/East European/Eurasian Cultures</h4>
<p>This track offers an interdisciplinary area studies approach. For this major track, students chose between two concentrations: Russian, or Armenian/Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian/Czech/Hungarian/Polish. Two years of study (or the equivalent) in Russian or another language are required. This major track integrates the study of languages and cultures of a large area: Russia, East Central Europe, Southeastern Europe, and Eurasia. Students design their own programs by selecting courses offered by the Slavic department and other departments such as History, Political Economy, Geography, Political Science, Peace and Conflict Studies, Anthropology, and others. While all majors in this track will gain some knowledge of the whole area, the program also allows each student to emphasize a specific cultural region, compare different regions, and/or define a particular field of study.</p>
<p>Students are advised to see the major adviser in advance to prepare an individualized study list plan.</p>
<h4>Russian Language and Literature</h4>
<p>This track focuses specifically on Russian language and literature. It requires three years of language coursework (or the equivalent). This major track integrates the study of Russian language, literature, and culture. Students will learn what defines Russia’s unique place in civilization both in earlier times and in today’s world. Students are advised to see the major adviser in advance to prepare an individualized study plan.</p>
<p><strong>Declaring the Major</strong></p>
<p>All students must see the major adviser for consultation, language proficiency referral (as needed), and study list planning and approval prior to pursuing a major track. <span>Students may declare their major upon entry to the University. However, the department encourages one year of study in the student’s major language prior to declaration.</span></p>
<h3><span>Heritage Speakers of Russian</span></h3>
<p>Heritage speakers include those who grew up in Russian speaking families or communities but without a standard Russian language educational background. Heritage speakers may select any major or minor track offered by the Department except the minor in Russian language. The requirements may change depending on each student’s language proficiency and academic interests. Consult the Major Advisor for language testing and individualized plan of study.</p>
<h3><span>Honors Program</span></h3>
<p>Slavic majors with a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 overall and in courses for the major are invited to consult with members of the faculty and the major adviser in the spring of their junior year about the honors program and a thesis topic. Requirements for the honors program in Slavic include an additional upper division Slavic course chosen by the student and an honors thesis course (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SLAVIC%20H195" title="SLAVIC H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SLAVIC H195');">SLAVIC H195</a></span><span>).</span></p>

<p>In the honors thesis course, normally taken during the fall semester of the senior year, the student will write a thesis under the direction of a member of the faculty (the thesis director). In order to enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SLAVIC%20H195" title="SLAVIC H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SLAVIC H195');">SLAVIC H195</a></span>, students must file an application with the department (available from the undergraduate student services adviser). This application includes a preliminary statement of the thesis topic and the names and signatures of the honors committee—the faculty director and one additional faculty member who also read the completed thesis—and the department chair.</p>

<h3>Minors offered by the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures</h3>

<h3>Major Track in Russian/East European/Eurasian Languages and Cultures</h3>
<p>This major track integrates the study of languages and cultures of a large area: Russia, East Central Europe, Southeastern Europe, and Eurasia. Students design their own programs by selecting courses offered by the Slavic and other departments and programs, such as Anthropology, Economics, Geography, Global Studies, History, Journalism, Legal Studies, Political Science, Sociology, Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies. While all majors in this track will gain knowledge of the whole area, the program also allows each student <u>to concentrate on a particular language and culture.</u> Students are advised to see the Undergraduate Advisor in advance to prepare an individualized study plan.</p>

Books written for children emerge from specific and complicated social and historical contexts, as do the children (and adults) who read these books. In recent years, the world of children's books has been rocked by productive debates about the kinds of stories told and the identities of the voices telling those stories. In this class, we will read a wide assortment of books written (both long ago and very recently) for children, with particular attention paid to</span><span class="deschide"> books addressing the experiences of Native, Latinx and African American children in the United States. We will also read scholarly, critical, and theoretical articles as we engage with our texts. Assessment will be based on class participation, written papers, and exams.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures offers three different major tracks.</p>
<h4>Russian/East European/Eurasian Cultures</h4>
<p>This track offers an interdisciplinary area studies approach. For this major track, students chose between two concentrations: Russian, or Armenian/Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian/Czech/Hungarian/Polish. Two years of study (or the equivalent) in Russian or another language are required. This major track integrates the study of languages and cultures of a large area: Russia, East Central Europe, Southeastern Europe, and Eurasia. Students design their own programs by selecting courses offered by the Slavic department and other departments such as History, Political Economy, Geography, Political Science, Peace and Conflict Studies, Anthropology, and others. While all majors in this track will gain some knowledge of the whole area, the program also allows each student to emphasize a specific cultural region, compare different regions, and/or define a particular field of study.</p>
<p>Students are advised to see the major adviser in advance to prepare an individualized study list plan.</p>
<h4>Russian Language and Literature</h4>
<p>This track focuses specifically on Russian language and literature. It requires three years of language coursework (or the equivalent). This major track integrates the study of Russian language, literature, and culture. Students will learn what defines Russia’s unique place in civilization both in earlier times and in today’s world. Students are advised to see the major adviser in advance to prepare an individualized study plan.</p>
<p><strong>Declaring the Major</strong></p>
<p>All students must see the major adviser for consultation, language proficiency referral (as needed), and study list planning and approval prior to pursuing a major track. <span>Students may declare their major upon entry to the University. However, the department encourages one year of study in the student’s major language prior to declaration.</span></p>
<h3><span>Heritage Speakers of Russian</span></h3>
<p>Heritage speakers include those who grew up in Russian speaking families or communities but without a standard Russian language educational background. Heritage speakers may select any major or minor track offered by the Department except the minor in Russian language. The requirements may change depending on each student’s language proficiency and academic interests. Consult the Major Advisor for language testing and individualized plan of study.</p>
<h3><span>Honors Program</span></h3>
<p>Slavic majors with a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 overall and in courses for the major are invited to consult with members of the faculty and the major adviser in the spring of their junior year about the honors program and a thesis topic. Requirements for the honors program in Slavic include an additional upper division Slavic course chosen by the student and an honors thesis course (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SLAVIC%20H195" title="SLAVIC H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SLAVIC H195');">SLAVIC H195</a></span><span>).</span></p>

<p>In the honors thesis course, normally taken during the fall semester of the senior year, the student will write a thesis under the direction of a member of the faculty (the thesis director). In order to enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SLAVIC%20H195" title="SLAVIC H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SLAVIC H195');">SLAVIC H195</a></span>, students must file an application with the department (available from the undergraduate student services adviser). This application includes a preliminary statement of the thesis topic and the names and signatures of the honors committee—the faculty director and one additional faculty member who also read the completed thesis—and the department chair.</p>

<h3>Minors offered by the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures</h3>

Books written for children emerge from specific and complicated social and historical contexts, as do the children (and adults) who read these books. In recent years, the world of children's books has been rocked by productive debates about the kinds of stories told and the identities of the voices telling those stories. In this class, we will read a wide assortment of books written (both long ago and very recently) for children, with particular attention paid to</span><span class="deschide"> books addressing the experiences of Native, Latinx and African American children in the United States. We will also read scholarly, critical, and theoretical articles as we engage with our texts. Assessment will be based on class participation, written papers, and exams.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures offers three different major tracks.</p>
<h4>Russian/East European/Eurasian Cultures</h4>
<p>This track offers an interdisciplinary area studies approach. For this major track, students chose between two concentrations: Russian, or Armenian/Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian/Czech/Hungarian/Polish. Two years of study (or the equivalent) in Russian or another language are required. This major track integrates the study of languages and cultures of a large area: Russia, East Central Europe, Southeastern Europe, and Eurasia. Students design their own programs by selecting courses offered by the Slavic department and other departments such as History, Political Economy, Geography, Political Science, Peace and Conflict Studies, Anthropology, and others. While all majors in this track will gain some knowledge of the whole area, the program also allows each student to emphasize a specific cultural region, compare different regions, and/or define a particular field of study.</p>
<p>Students are advised to see the major adviser in advance to prepare an individualized study list plan.</p>
<h4>Russian Language and Literature</h4>
<p>This track focuses specifically on Russian language and literature. It requires three years of language coursework (or the equivalent). This major track integrates the study of Russian language, literature, and culture. Students will learn what defines Russia’s unique place in civilization both in earlier times and in today’s world. Students are advised to see the major adviser in advance to prepare an individualized study plan.</p>
<p><strong>Declaring the Major</strong></p>
<p>All students must see the major adviser for consultation, language proficiency referral (as needed), and study list planning and approval prior to pursuing a major track. <span>Students may declare their major upon entry to the University. However, the department encourages one year of study in the student’s major language prior to declaration.</span></p>
<h3><span>Heritage Speakers of Russian</span></h3>
<p>Heritage speakers include those who grew up in Russian speaking families or communities but without a standard Russian language educational background. Heritage speakers may select any major or minor track offered by the Department except the minor in Russian language. The requirements may change depending on each student’s language proficiency and academic interests. Consult the Major Advisor for language testing and individualized plan of study.</p>
<h3><span>Honors Program</span></h3>
<p>Slavic majors with a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 overall and in courses for the major are invited to consult with members of the faculty and the major adviser in the spring of their junior year about the honors program and a thesis topic. Requirements for the honors program in Slavic include an additional upper division Slavic course chosen by the student and an honors thesis course (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SLAVIC%20H195" title="SLAVIC H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SLAVIC H195');">SLAVIC H195</a></span><span>).</span></p>

<p>In the honors thesis course, normally taken during the fall semester of the senior year, the student will write a thesis under the direction of a member of the faculty (the thesis director). In order to enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SLAVIC%20H195" title="SLAVIC H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SLAVIC H195');">SLAVIC H195</a></span>, students must file an application with the department (available from the undergraduate student services adviser). This application includes a preliminary statement of the thesis topic and the names and signatures of the honors committee—the faculty director and one additional faculty member who also read the completed thesis—and the department chair.</p>

<h3>Minors offered by the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures</h3>

<h3>Major Track in Russian/East European/Eurasian Languages and Cultures</h3>
<p>This major track integrates the study of languages and cultures of a large area: Russia, East Central Europe, Southeastern Europe, and Eurasia. Students design their own programs by selecting courses offered by the Slavic and other departments and programs, such as Anthropology, Economics, Geography, Global Studies, History, Journalism, Legal Studies, Political Science, Sociology, Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies. While all majors in this track will gain knowledge of the whole area, the program also allows each student <u>to concentrate on a particular language and culture.</u> Students are advised to see the Undergraduate Advisor in advance to prepare an individualized study plan.</p>

Books written for children emerge from specific and complicated social and historical contexts, as do the children (and adults) who read these books. In recent years, the world of children's books has been rocked by productive debates about the kinds of stories told and the identities of the voices telling those stories. In this class, we will read a wide assortment of books written (both long ago and very recently) for children, with particular attention paid to</span><span class="deschide"> books addressing the experiences of Native, Latinx and African American children in the United States. We will also read scholarly, critical, and theoretical articles as we engage with our texts. Assessment will be based on class participation, written papers, and exams.</span><br/>
