				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. These curricula include the core courses in each of the major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. Both majors are shown on the student's transcript of record.</p>
<p>For students interested in materials and devices, a joint major in electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS)/materials science and engineering (MSE) can be valuable. The program combines the study of materials from a broad perspective, as taught in MSE, with the study of their applications in electronic devices and circuits, as taught in EECS.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Joint Major</h3>
<p>Admission directly to a joint major is closed to freshmen and junior transfer applicants. Students interested in a joint program may apply to change majors during specific times in their academic progress. Please see the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors">College of Engineering joint majors website</a> for complete details.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

				<a name="fiveyearbsmstext"></a><h2>Five-Year BS/MS</h2><p>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well. It is not intended for students who have definitely decided to pursue a PhD immediately following graduation. Those students are advised to apply for a PhD program at Berkeley or elsewhere during their senior year. Students who have been accepted into the five-year BA/MS or BS/MS are free to change their minds later and apply to enter the PhD program or apply to a PhD program at another university. Note that admission is competitive with all our PhD applicants.</p>
<p>The program is focused on interdisciplinary training at a graduate level; with at least 8 units of course work outside EECS required. Students will emerge as leaders in their technical and professional fields.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Focused on interdisciplinary study and more experience in aligned technical fields such as physics, materials science, statistics, biology, etc., and/or professional disciplines such as management of technology, business law, and public policy.</li>
	<li>If admitted to the program, students must begin the graduate portion in the semester immediately following the conferral of the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only one additional year (two semesters) is permitted beyond the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only available to Berkeley EECS and L&amp;S CS undergraduates.</li>
	<li>Participants in program may serve as graduate student instructors with approval from their faculty research advisor and the 5th Year MS Committee.</li>
	<li>Participants in program are self-funded.</li>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis</span><span class="deschide">, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> <br/>
Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
<br/>
•<br/>
Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
•<br/>
Understanding of the origin of surface forces and interfacial free energy, and how they contribute to the development of the biomaterial interface and ultimately biomaterial performance.<br/></p></div>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. These curricula include the core courses in each of the major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. Both majors are shown on the student's transcript of record.</p>
<p>For students interested in materials and devices, a joint major in electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS)/materials science and engineering (MSE) can be valuable. The program combines the study of materials from a broad perspective, as taught in MSE, with the study of their applications in electronic devices and circuits, as taught in EECS.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Joint Major</h3>
<p>Admission directly to a joint major is closed to freshmen and junior transfer applicants. Students interested in a joint program may apply to change majors during specific times in their academic progress. Please see the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors">College of Engineering joint majors website</a> for complete details.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

				<a name="fiveyearbsmstext"></a><h2>Five-Year BS/MS</h2><p>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well. It is not intended for students who have definitely decided to pursue a PhD immediately following graduation. Those students are advised to apply for a PhD program at Berkeley or elsewhere during their senior year. Students who have been accepted into the five-year BA/MS or BS/MS are free to change their minds later and apply to enter the PhD program or apply to a PhD program at another university. Note that admission is competitive with all our PhD applicants.</p>
<p>The program is focused on interdisciplinary training at a graduate level; with at least 8 units of course work outside EECS required. Students will emerge as leaders in their technical and professional fields.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Focused on interdisciplinary study and more experience in aligned technical fields such as physics, materials science, statistics, biology, etc., and/or professional disciplines such as management of technology, business law, and public policy.</li>
	<li>If admitted to the program, students must begin the graduate portion in the semester immediately following the conferral of the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only one additional year (two semesters) is permitted beyond the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only available to Berkeley EECS and L&amp;S CS undergraduates.</li>
	<li>Participants in program may serve as graduate student instructors with approval from their faculty research advisor and the 5th Year MS Committee.</li>
	<li>Participants in program are self-funded.</li>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis</span><span class="deschide">, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> <br/>
Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
<br/>
•<br/>
Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
•<br/>
Understanding of the origin of surface forces and interfacial free energy, and how they contribute to the development of the biomaterial interface and ultimately biomaterial performance.<br/></p></div>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. These curricula include the core courses in each of the major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. Both majors are shown on the student's transcript of record.</p>
<p>For students interested in materials and devices, a joint major in electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS)/materials science and engineering (MSE) can be valuable. The program combines the study of materials from a broad perspective, as taught in MSE, with the study of their applications in electronic devices and circuits, as taught in EECS.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Joint Major</h3>
<p>Admission directly to a joint major is closed to freshmen and junior transfer applicants. Students interested in a joint program may apply to change majors during specific times in their academic progress. Please see the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors">College of Engineering joint majors website</a> for complete details.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

				<a name="fiveyearbsmstext"></a><h2>Five-Year BS/MS</h2><p>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well. It is not intended for students who have definitely decided to pursue a PhD immediately following graduation. Those students are advised to apply for a PhD program at Berkeley or elsewhere during their senior year. Students who have been accepted into the five-year BA/MS or BS/MS are free to change their minds later and apply to enter the PhD program or apply to a PhD program at another university. Note that admission is competitive with all our PhD applicants.</p>
<p>The program is focused on interdisciplinary training at a graduate level; with at least 8 units of course work outside EECS required. Students will emerge as leaders in their technical and professional fields.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Focused on interdisciplinary study and more experience in aligned technical fields such as physics, materials science, statistics, biology, etc., and/or professional disciplines such as management of technology, business law, and public policy.</li>
	<li>If admitted to the program, students must begin the graduate portion in the semester immediately following the conferral of the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only one additional year (two semesters) is permitted beyond the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only available to Berkeley EECS and L&amp;S CS undergraduates.</li>
	<li>Participants in program may serve as graduate student instructors with approval from their faculty research advisor and the 5th Year MS Committee.</li>
	<li>Participants in program are self-funded.</li>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis</span><span class="deschide">, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> <br/>
Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
<br/>
•<br/>
Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
•<br/>
Understanding of the origin of surface forces and interfacial free energy, and how they contribute to the development of the biomaterial interface and ultimately biomaterial performance.<br/></p></div>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. These curricula include the core courses in each of the major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. Both majors are shown on the student's transcript of record.</p>
<p>For students interested in materials and devices, a joint major in electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS)/materials science and engineering (MSE) can be valuable. The program combines the study of materials from a broad perspective, as taught in MSE, with the study of their applications in electronic devices and circuits, as taught in EECS.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Joint Major</h3>
<p>Admission directly to a joint major is closed to freshmen and junior transfer applicants. Students interested in a joint program may apply to change majors during specific times in their academic progress. Please see the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors">College of Engineering joint majors website</a> for complete details.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

				<a name="fiveyearbsmstext"></a><h2>Five-Year BS/MS</h2><p>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well. It is not intended for students who have definitely decided to pursue a PhD immediately following graduation. Those students are advised to apply for a PhD program at Berkeley or elsewhere during their senior year. Students who have been accepted into the five-year BA/MS or BS/MS are free to change their minds later and apply to enter the PhD program or apply to a PhD program at another university. Note that admission is competitive with all our PhD applicants.</p>
<p>The program is focused on interdisciplinary training at a graduate level; with at least 8 units of course work outside EECS required. Students will emerge as leaders in their technical and professional fields.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Focused on interdisciplinary study and more experience in aligned technical fields such as physics, materials science, statistics, biology, etc., and/or professional disciplines such as management of technology, business law, and public policy.</li>
	<li>If admitted to the program, students must begin the graduate portion in the semester immediately following the conferral of the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only one additional year (two semesters) is permitted beyond the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only available to Berkeley EECS and L&amp;S CS undergraduates.</li>
	<li>Participants in program may serve as graduate student instructors with approval from their faculty research advisor and the 5th Year MS Committee.</li>
	<li>Participants in program are self-funded.</li>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis</span><span class="deschide">, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> <br/>
Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
<br/>
•<br/>
Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
•<br/>
Understanding of the origin of surface forces and interfacial free energy, and how they contribute to the development of the biomaterial interface and ultimately biomaterial performance.<br/></p></div>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. These curricula include the core courses in each of the major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. Both majors are shown on the student's transcript of record.</p>
<p>For students interested in materials and devices, a joint major in electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS)/materials science and engineering (MSE) can be valuable. The program combines the study of materials from a broad perspective, as taught in MSE, with the study of their applications in electronic devices and circuits, as taught in EECS.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Joint Major</h3>
<p>Admission directly to a joint major is closed to freshmen and junior transfer applicants. Students interested in a joint program may apply to change majors during specific times in their academic progress. Please see the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors">College of Engineering joint majors website</a> for complete details.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

				<a name="fiveyearbsmstext"></a><h2>Five-Year BS/MS</h2><p>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well. It is not intended for students who have definitely decided to pursue a PhD immediately following graduation. Those students are advised to apply for a PhD program at Berkeley or elsewhere during their senior year. Students who have been accepted into the five-year BA/MS or BS/MS are free to change their minds later and apply to enter the PhD program or apply to a PhD program at another university. Note that admission is competitive with all our PhD applicants.</p>
<p>The program is focused on interdisciplinary training at a graduate level; with at least 8 units of course work outside EECS required. Students will emerge as leaders in their technical and professional fields.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Focused on interdisciplinary study and more experience in aligned technical fields such as physics, materials science, statistics, biology, etc., and/or professional disciplines such as management of technology, business law, and public policy.</li>
	<li>If admitted to the program, students must begin the graduate portion in the semester immediately following the conferral of the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only one additional year (two semesters) is permitted beyond the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only available to Berkeley EECS and L&amp;S CS undergraduates.</li>
	<li>Participants in program may serve as graduate student instructors with approval from their faculty research advisor and the 5th Year MS Committee.</li>
	<li>Participants in program are self-funded.</li>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis</span><span class="deschide">, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> <br/>
Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
<br/>
•<br/>
Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
•<br/>
Understanding of the origin of surface forces and interfacial free energy, and how they contribute to the development of the biomaterial interface and ultimately biomaterial performance.<br/></p></div>
