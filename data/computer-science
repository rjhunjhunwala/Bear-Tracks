				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Choosing a Computer Science Path</h3>
<p>There are two ways to study Computer Science (CS) at UC Berkeley:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Be admitted to the Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Sciences (EECS) major in the College of Engineering (COE) as a freshman. Admission to the COE, however, is extremely competitive. This option leads to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree. This path is appropriate for people who want an engineering education.</li>
	<li>Enter the College of Letters &amp; Science (L&amp;S) and, after successful completion of the courses required to declare with the minimum grade point average (GPA), petition to be admitted to the L&amp;S Computer Science major. This path is appropriate for people who are interested in a broader education in the sciences and arts (such as double majoring in other L&amp;S fields), and/or are not sure at the time of application that they can gain admission to EECS. This option leads to a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no difference in the CS course content between the BS and BA programs. The difference is in what else you take: mainly engineering, or mainly humanities and social sciences. In particular, an interest in hardware suggests the EECS route; an interest in double majoring (for example, in math or cognitive science) suggests the L&amp;S route.</p>
<h3><span>Bachelor of Science (BS) in Computer Science</span></h3>
<p>For information regarding the BS degree, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/electrical-engineering-computer-sciences/">Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences program</a> information in this Guide. </p>
<h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Computer Science</h3>
<p>This CS major is for students enrolled in the College of Letters &amp; Science (<a href="http://ls.berkeley.edu/">L&amp;S</a>). Berkeley emphasizes the science of computer science, which means much more than just computer programming. It includes the theory of computation, the design and analysis of algorithms, the architecture and logic design of computers, programming languages, compilers, operating systems, scientific computation, computer graphics, databases, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing. Our goal is to prepare students both for a possible research career and long-term technical leadership in industry. We must therefore look beyond today's technology and give students the primary ideas and the learning skills that will prepare them to teach themselves about tomorrow's technology.</p>
<h3><span>Declaring the Major (BA only)</span></h3>
<div>
<p>It is necessary to achieve a minimum prerequisite grade point average (GPA) in order to declare the Computer Science major. Information on this GPA and the process to petition for admission to the major can be found on the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/csugrad/#petitioning">Petitioning to the Computer Science Major</a> website.</p>
</div>
<p>Transfer students admitted to Berkeley must apply separately to the Computer Science major after matriculating and completing the missing prerequisite courses for declaration. Not all transfer students will meet the criteria required for the major. Therefore, we recommend that transfer students be prepared to pursue an alternative major at Berkeley. Questions may be directed to the CS advising office, 349 Soda Hall, 510-664-4436, or via email at cs-advising@cs.berkeley.edu. </p>
<h3>Five-Year BS/MS Program</h3>
<p>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well. For information, please see the Five-Year BS/MS Requirements tab on this page. </p>
<h3><span>Honors Program</span></h3>
<p>Computer Science majors with an overall GPA of 3.70 or above are eligible to apply to the EECS honors degree program.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>A minor in Computer Science is available to all undergraduate students at Berkeley with a declared major, with the exception of EECS majors. For information regarding minor requirements, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/csugrad/index.shtml#cs" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements (BA)</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be 3 or more units and taken for a letter grade.</li>
	<li>
	<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All courses for the major must be technical in nature. Courses numbered 199, 198, 197, 196, 195, plus select 194, 191, 190, and various seminars do not count. If you are unsure, please check with the CS advisers (<a href="mailto:cs-advising@cs.berkeley.edu"><span class="s2">cs-advising@cs.berkeley.edu</span></a>).</span></p>
	</li>
	<li><span class="s1">Only</span><span class="s2"> one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs. </span>No more than two upper division courses can overlap between two majors.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding residence requirements and unit requirements, please see the College Requirements tab.</p>

				<a name="fiveyearbsmsrequirementstext"></a><h2>Five-Year BS/MS</h2><p><span>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well. It is not intended for students who have definitely decided to pursue a PhD immediately following graduation. Those students are advised to apply for a PhD program at Berkeley or elsewhere during their senior year. Students who have been accepted into the Five-Year BA/MS or BS/MS are free to change their minds later and apply to enter the PhD program or apply to a PhD program at another university. Note that admission is competitive with all our PhD applicants.</span></p>
<p>The program is focused on interdisciplinary training at a graduate level; with at least 8 units of course work outside EECS required. Students will emerge as leaders in their technical and professional fields.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Focused on interdisciplinary study and more experience in aligned technical fields such as physics, materials science, statistics, biology, etc., and/or professional disciplines such as management of technology, business, law, and public policy.</li>
	<li>If admitted to the program, students must begin the graduate portion in the semester immediately following the conferral of the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only one additional year (two semesters) beyond the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only available to Berkeley EECS and L&amp;S CS undergraduates.</li>
	<li>Participants in the program may serve as graduate student instructors (GSIs) with approval from their faculty research advisor and the Five-Year MS Committee.</li>
	<li>Participants in the program are self-funded.</li>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of two of these three-upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley. A maximum of one course can transfer from study abroad.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>Starting Fall 2020, students must declare the minor one semester before their final term. Students graduating Summer 2020 and prior may declare their minor during the same term they are graduating.</li>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement. These courses focus upon how the diversity of America's constituent cultural traditions have shaped and continue to shape American identity and experience.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Visit the </span><a href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a> or the <a href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/">American Cultures website</a> for the specific American Cultures courses offered each semester. For a complete list of approved American Cultures courses at UC Berkeley and California Community Colleges, please see the <a href="https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/amcult">American Cultures Subcommittee’s website</a>. See your academic adviser if you have questions about your responsibility to satisfy the American Cultures breadth requirement.</p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-921eb48b-58b3-65cc-aa05-df63aa36c189">For students considering graduating in less than four years, it's important to acknowledge the reasons to undertake such a plan of study. While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation. All things considered, please see the tables for three and three and a half year degree options.</span></p>

This lab covers the design of modern digital systems with Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platforms. A series of lab exercises provide the background and practice of digital design using a modern FPGA design tool flow. Digital synthesis, partitioning, placement, routing, and simulation tools for FPGAs are covered in detail. The labs exercises culminate with a large design project, e.g., an implementation of a full three-stage RISC-V processor</span><span class="deschide"> system, with caches, graphics acceleration, and external peripheral components. The design is mapped and demonstrated on an FPGA hardware platform.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> C8R also includes quantitative reasoning concepts that aren’t covered in Data 8. These include certain topics in: principles of data visualization; simulation of random processes; and understanding numerical functions through their graphs. This will help prepare students for computational and quantitative courses other than Data 8.<br/>C8R takes advantage of the complementarity of computing and quantitative reasoning to enliven abstract ideas and build students’ confidence in their ability to solve real problems with quantitative tools. Students learn computer science concepts and immediately apply them to plot functions, visualize data, and simulate random events.<br/>
<br/>Foundations of Data Science (CS/Info/Stat C8, a.k.a. Data 8) is an increasingly popular class for entering students at Berkeley. Data 8 builds students’ computing skills in the first month of the semester, and students rely on these skills as the course progresses. For some students, particularly those with little prior exposure to computing, developing these skills benefits from further time and practice. C8R is a rapid introduction to Python programming, visualization, and data analysis, which will prepare students for success in Data 8.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will be able to perform basic computations in Python, including working with tabular data.<br/>
Students will be able to understand basic probabilistic simulations.<br/>
Students will be able to understand the syntactic structure of Python code.<br/>
Students will be able to use good practices in Python programming.<br/>
Students will be able to use visualizations to understand univariate data and to identify associations or causal relationships in bivariate data.</p></div>

Cryptography or cryptology is the science of designing algorithms and protocols for enabling parties to communicate and compute securely in an untrusted environment (e.g. secure communication, digital signature, etc.) Over the last four decades, cryptography has transformed from an ad hoc collection of mysterious tricks into a rigorous science based on firm complexity-theoretic foundations. This modern complexity-theoretic</span><span class="deschide"> approach to cryptography will be the focus. E.g., in the context of encryption we will begin by giving a precise mathematical definition for what it means to be a secure encryption scheme and then give a construction (realizing this security notion) assuming various computational hardness assumptions (e.g. factoring).</span><br/>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis</span><span class="deschide">, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br/>
