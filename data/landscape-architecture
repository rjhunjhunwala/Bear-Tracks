				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Berkeley's undergraduate curriculum in Landscape Architecture centers upon creative and ecologically-tuned design and introduces students to the breadth of knowledge common to the profession. This program leads to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Landscape Architecture and provides the necessary education for students interested in entry-level professional practice.</p>
<p>At the heart of the undergraduate curriculum are three core studios: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LD%20ARCH%20101" title="LD ARCH 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LD ARCH 101');">LD ARCH 101</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LD%20ARCH%20102" title="LD ARCH 102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LD ARCH 102');">LD ARCH 102</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LD%20ARCH%20103" title="LD ARCH 103" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LD ARCH 103');">LD ARCH 103</a></span>. The core studios ensure that undergraduate students benefit from the department's full range of interests and expertise.</p>

<h3>Licensure and Accreditation</h3>
<p>The BA degree is certified by the State of California and counts as part of the education/experience requirement of the Uniform National Examination (U.N.E.) as well as for the Landscape Architects Registration Examination (L.A.R.E.) for licensure. Please visit the <a href="http://www.latc.ca.gov/">Landscape Architects Technical Committee</a> and the <a href="https://www.clarb.org/">Council of Landscape Architectural Registration Boards</a> for more information about licensure in California.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Students must declare one of the CED majors at the time of application to the College. However, current UC Berkeley students may apply to change into the College of Environmental Design. Transfer applicants must complete two years worth of lower division coursework to be considered for admission to CED. For information regarding admission to the major for freshmen, transfer students, and current students who wish to change majors or colleges, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/colleges-schools/environmental-design/#choosingamajortext">College of Environmental Design (CED) page</a> in this Bulletin or the <a href="http://ced.berkeley.edu/admissions/undergraduate/">CED website</a>.</p>
<h3>History and Theory of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Design Minor Program</h3>
<p>This program introduces students to conceptual issues of landscape architecture. A letter grade of C- or higher in ENV DES 1, LD ARCH 1, or LD ARCH 12 is required to declare the minor. To declare, students must submit the <a href="https://ced.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-advising/forms-documents/">CED Request to Add Minor Form</a>, available on the CED website. Open to all majors at UC Berkeley except Landscape Architecture.</p>
<h3>Other Minors Offered by the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning</h3>
<p>The Department sponsors a minor in Sustainable Design, in conjunction with the Department of Architecture. For further information regarding this minor program, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/sustainable-design/">program's page in this Guide</a>.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/landscape-architecture-environmental-planning/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The College of Environmental Design (CED) Office of Undergraduate Advising helps students graduate in a timely way with a meaningful educational experience at Berkeley. In alignment with the College's Vision and Principles, the Office collaborates with CED faculty, deans, and student service units across campus toward the common objective of supporting students as they achieve their educational and career goals. The CED Office of Undergraduate Advising seeks to accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Attract a highly-motivated, diverse pool of applicants.</li>
	<li>Connect students with resources that match their goals and aspirations.</li>
	<li>Support the development and transformation of undergraduates as they become educated, active and socially just citizens of the world.</li>
	<li>Prepare graduates who are uniquely qualified and highly sought after in their field of choice.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advising Values</h3>
<p><strong>Student Success.</strong> Above all, CED dedicates itself to maximizing student potential and to helping students succeed in their university experiences. CED encourages students to explore their minds and their hearts, challenge them to do their best work, and help them realize their talents and passions and achieve their goals.</p>
<p><strong>Equity &amp; Inclusion. </strong>CED is committed to creating an inclusive environment in which any individual or group can be and feel welcomed, respected, supported and valued.

This is an undergraduate studio with a central focus on climate modification for energy conservation. We will research historical precedents in order to develop new garden forms for passive green designs. We will also explore how past cultures integrated metaphysics into their gardens as an adjunct to microclimate and habitat design. The contemporary landscape should be a balanced interweaving of proportion, function, comfort, energy conservation</span><span class="deschide">, and enlightenment. Additionally, we will study the choreography of space and investigate how to animate the landscape through the creative interpretation of text and film. Many new and exciting opportunities lie ahead for the creation of garden forms that not only conserve energy, but are also works of art and places of spiritual renewal.</span><br/>

This course presents an overview of relevant hydrologic, hydraulic, and geomorphic processes, to provide the planner and ecologist with insight to incorporate these processes into the planning process and coordinate with specialists in the field of hydrology. Relevant government regulations and policies are also reviewed. The course is not intended to duplicate more specialized courses offered in such fields as engineering hydrology, coastal</span><span class="deschide"> engineering, or geology, but rather to provide an integrated understanding. The course takes a process- and field-based approach to hydrology, and emphasizes interdisciplinary perspectives.</span><br/>

This course is an introduction to issues of sustainability in the designed landscape and in our cities. It includes environmental history as well as contemporary social, environmental and political issues surrounding sustainable design and activism. The course stresses motives and values expressed through environmental design at various scales – from neighborhood to global and examines problems affecting healthy</span><span class="deschide"> environments and their solutions. Students study the need for protection and restoration of healthy ecological systems within the design of cities and landscapes and discuss ways to enable these systems to thrive. Readings and discussions focus on means to evaluate, create and advocate for healthy, sustainable environments.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> This course is an important elective to majors in the College of Natural Resources and CED students who have Architecture and City Planning majors. A new CED major, Sustainable Environmental Design (SED), has increased the number of students who require this class. It also fulfills the Social and Behavioral breadth requirement. Therefore, it is clear that the course enrollment should be increased to accommodate students from both inside and outside the CED.<br/>
This course offers students the opportunity to examine a specific range of sustainable design interventions that attempt to address primary problems related to climate change, the need for healthy watersheds, adequate food security and socially resilient communities in the face of rapid environmental change. Students will see the complexity of various aspects and approaches required of sustainable design and occasionally competing goals of a project.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> On the required field trip to San Francisco, students will be able to see and critique the efficacy of policy; of existing and emerging landscape design technology; to observe interventions intended to assist existing natural systems in urban environments and promote their viability; to see the value of community building to help establish resilient neighborhoods; to become verbally articulate about these issues.<br/>
Students will learn about and discuss the inter-connectedness of natural systems overlapped by human habitation. They will learn about design that can facilitate positive social systems and how the combination of ecological and social communities can present answers to some of the pressing environmental problems we face. Students will learn how various design strategies involve land preservation, watershed protection and restoration; local food production networks; resilient neighborhood design through community participation in open space design; pedestrian and bicycle friendly streets, urban forestry; reducing the waste stream.</p></div>
