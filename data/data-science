				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">Bachelor of Arts (BA)</span></h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">The Data Science Major degree program combines computational and inferential reasoning to draw conclusions based on data about some aspect of the real world. Data scientists come from all walks of life, all areas of study, and all backgrounds. They share an appreciation for the practical use of mathematical and scientific thinking and the power of computing to understand and solve problems for business, research, and societal impact.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">The Data Science Major will equip students to draw sound conclusions from data in context, using knowledge of statistical inference, computational processes, data management strategies, domain knowledge, and theory. Students will learn to carry out analyses of data through the full cycle of the investigative process in scientific and practical contexts. Students will gain an understanding of the human and ethical implications of data analytics and integrate that knowledge in designing and carrying out their work.</span></p>
<p><span>The Data Science major requirements include &quot;Data 8&quot; </span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">(<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=STAT%20C8" title="STAT C8" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'STAT C8');">STAT C8</a></span></span>
) and &quot;Data 100&quot; (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=COMPSCI%20C100" title="COMPSCI C100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'COMPSCI C100');">COMPSCI C100</a></span>), the core lower-division and upper-division elements of the major, along with courses from each of the following requirement groups:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Foundations in Mathematics and Computing</li>
	<li>Computational and Inferential Depth</li>
	<li>Modeling, Learning and Decision Making</li>
	<li>Probability</li>
	<li>Human Contexts and Ethics</li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">Domain Emphasis</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">All students will select a Domain Emphasis, a cluster of one lower division course and two upper division courses, that brings them into the context of a domain and allows them </span>to build bridges with data science.</p>
<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">Declaring the Major</span></h3>
<p>Students can apply to declare the Data Science major after completing all the lower-division prerequisites (see the Major Requirements tab). For applicants with prerequisites in progress, applications will be reviewed after the grades for all prerequisites are available.</p>
<p>It is necessary for applicants to achieve a minimum prerequisite grade point average (GPA) in order to declare the Data Science major. Information on this GPA and the process to apply for admission to the major can be found on the <a href="http://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/data-science-ba/declaring" target="_blank">Declaring the Major</a> web page.</p>
<h3><span>Minor Program</span></h3>
<p>We expect that a minor in Data Science will be available to students from all Colleges, except for students with a Data Science major. The proposal for the minor program is currently in development. <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Check the Data Science program website</a> for details and status updates.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">VISIT PROGRAM WEBSITE</a></p>

Please check the</span></span> <a href="http://data.berkeley.edu/degrees">Data Science program website</a> for updates.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>Only one upper-division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs. No more than two upper-division courses can overlap between two majors.</li>
	<li><span>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</span></li>

				<a name="domainemphasistext"></a><h2>Domain Emphasis</h2><p>Domain Emphases give students a grounded understanding of a particular domain of data-intensive research, relevant theory, or an integrative intellectual thread. A Domain Emphasis is comprised of three courses chosen from a list. Each Domain Emphasis is rooted in a lower division course, which is typically also a prerequisite for the upper division courses. </p>
<div>
<p>A Domain Emphasis is not limited to courses that are intended to be specifically for data science. Rather, they should bring the data science student into the context of a domain. That may involve understanding the vocabulary, methods of study, theoretical foundations, or cultural outlook of the domain. The student needs to become able to build the bridges with data science in carrying out the emphasis, rather than expecting each course to do it for them.</p>
<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-cfc44e51-0196-89fb-acce-70cd59eccbc7"><strong>Students</strong></span><strong><span> will select one course from a short list of lower-division prerequisites, and two courses from a list of upper-division courses. The lower division course is a required element of the Domain Emphasis.</span></strong></strong></p>
<h3><span>What to think about when selecting a domain emphasis:</span></h3>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Courses you take for the 7-course L&amp;S Breadth requirement may fulfill the lower-division course for a domain. Even if you don’t yet know which domain to choose, your breadths may work for you for the major as well.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Allow yourself some flexibility—choose three or four upper-division courses from the <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/domain-emphasis" target="_blank">course list</a> that you’d like to take, rather than two, so you can make sure you continue making progress if you are unable to take a particular course.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Be advised that it is important to examine whether seats are typically available in the courses for the domain you select—many courses in other departments have priority enrollment groups.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-091097ae-0197-5735-2227-6c42b68ac383">Some domain emphases are currently undergoing revision and are subject to change. </span>Course lists for each of the domain emphases are available on the <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/domain-emphasis" target="_blank">Data Science program website.</a></p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">The Data Science Major degree program combines computational and inferential reasoning to draw conclusions based on data about some aspect of the real world. Data scientists come from all walks of life, all areas of study, and all backgrounds. They share an appreciation for the practical use of mathematical and scientific thinking and the power of computing to understand and solve problems for business, research, and societal impact.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">The Data Science Major will equip students to draw sound conclusions from data in context, using knowledge of statistical inference, computational processes, data management strategies, domain knowledge, and theory. Students will learn to carry out analyses of data through the full cycle of the investigative process in scientific and practical contexts. Students will gain an understanding of the human and ethical implications of data analytics and integrate that knowledge in designing and carrying out their work.</span></p>
<p><span>The Data Science major requirements include &quot;Data 8&quot; </span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">(<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=STAT%20C8" title="STAT C8" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'STAT C8');">STAT C8</a></span></span>
) and &quot;Data 100&quot; (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=COMPSCI%20C100" title="COMPSCI C100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'COMPSCI C100');">COMPSCI C100</a></span>), the core lower-division and upper-division elements of the major, along with courses from each of the following requirement groups:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Foundations in Mathematics and Computing</li>
	<li>Computational and Inferential Depth</li>
	<li>Modeling, Learning and Decision Making</li>
	<li>Probability</li>
	<li>Human Contexts and Ethics</li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">Domain Emphasis</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">All students will select a Domain Emphasis, a cluster of one lower division course and two upper division courses, that brings them into the context of a domain and allows them </span>to build bridges with data science.</p>
<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">Declaring the Major</span></h3>
<p>Students can apply to declare the Data Science major after completing all the lower-division prerequisites (see the Major Requirements tab). For applicants with prerequisites in progress, applications will be reviewed after the grades for all prerequisites are available.</p>
<p>It is necessary for applicants to achieve a minimum prerequisite grade point average (GPA) in order to declare the Data Science major. Information on this GPA and the process to apply for admission to the major can be found on the <a href="http://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/data-science-ba/declaring" target="_blank">Declaring the Major</a> web page.</p>
<h3><span>Minor Program</span></h3>
<p>We expect that a minor in Data Science will be available to students from all Colleges, except for students with a Data Science major. The proposal for the minor program is currently in development. <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Check the Data Science program website</a> for details and status updates.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">VISIT PROGRAM WEBSITE</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-b98acf1b-83c5-06d4-2cec-e031beb79bde">In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to the major program. <span>As the program is new, these requirements may undergo changes. Please check the</span></span> <a href="http://data.berkeley.edu/degrees">Data Science program website</a> for updates.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>Only one upper-division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs. No more than two upper-division courses can overlap between two majors.</li>
	<li><span>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</span></li>

<p>A Domain Emphasis is not limited to courses that are intended to be specifically for data science. Rather, they should bring the data science student into the context of a domain. That may involve understanding the vocabulary, methods of study, theoretical foundations, or cultural outlook of the domain. The student needs to become able to build the bridges with data science in carrying out the emphasis, rather than expecting each course to do it for them.</p>
<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-cfc44e51-0196-89fb-acce-70cd59eccbc7"><strong>Students</strong></span><strong><span> will select one course from a short list of lower-division prerequisites, and two courses from a list of upper-division courses. The lower division course is a required element of the Domain Emphasis.</span></strong></strong></p>
<h3><span>What to think about when selecting a domain emphasis:</span></h3>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Courses you take for the 7-course L&amp;S Breadth requirement may fulfill the lower-division course for a domain. Even if you don’t yet know which domain to choose, your breadths may work for you for the major as well.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Allow yourself some flexibility—choose three or four upper-division courses from the <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/domain-emphasis" target="_blank">course list</a> that you’d like to take, rather than two, so you can make sure you continue making progress if you are unable to take a particular course.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Be advised that it is important to examine whether seats are typically available in the courses for the domain you select—many courses in other departments have priority enrollment groups.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-091097ae-0197-5735-2227-6c42b68ac383">Some domain emphases are currently undergoing revision and are subject to change. </span>Course lists for each of the domain emphases are available on the <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/domain-emphasis" target="_blank">Data Science program website.</a></p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">Bachelor of Arts (BA)</span></h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">The Data Science Major degree program combines computational and inferential reasoning to draw conclusions based on data about some aspect of the real world. Data scientists come from all walks of life, all areas of study, and all backgrounds. They share an appreciation for the practical use of mathematical and scientific thinking and the power of computing to understand and solve problems for business, research, and societal impact.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">The Data Science Major will equip students to draw sound conclusions from data in context, using knowledge of statistical inference, computational processes, data management strategies, domain knowledge, and theory. Students will learn to carry out analyses of data through the full cycle of the investigative process in scientific and practical contexts. Students will gain an understanding of the human and ethical implications of data analytics and integrate that knowledge in designing and carrying out their work.</span></p>
<p><span>The Data Science major requirements include &quot;Data 8&quot; </span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">(<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=STAT%20C8" title="STAT C8" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'STAT C8');">STAT C8</a></span></span>
) and &quot;Data 100&quot; (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=COMPSCI%20C100" title="COMPSCI C100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'COMPSCI C100');">COMPSCI C100</a></span>), the core lower-division and upper-division elements of the major, along with courses from each of the following requirement groups:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Foundations in Mathematics and Computing</li>
	<li>Computational and Inferential Depth</li>
	<li>Modeling, Learning and Decision Making</li>
	<li>Probability</li>
	<li>Human Contexts and Ethics</li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">Domain Emphasis</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">All students will select a Domain Emphasis, a cluster of one lower division course and two upper division courses, that brings them into the context of a domain and allows them </span>to build bridges with data science.</p>
<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">Declaring the Major</span></h3>
<p>Students can apply to declare the Data Science major after completing all the lower-division prerequisites (see the Major Requirements tab). For applicants with prerequisites in progress, applications will be reviewed after the grades for all prerequisites are available.</p>
<p>It is necessary for applicants to achieve a minimum prerequisite grade point average (GPA) in order to declare the Data Science major. Information on this GPA and the process to apply for admission to the major can be found on the <a href="http://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/data-science-ba/declaring" target="_blank">Declaring the Major</a> web page.</p>
<h3><span>Minor Program</span></h3>
<p>We expect that a minor in Data Science will be available to students from all Colleges, except for students with a Data Science major. The proposal for the minor program is currently in development. <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Check the Data Science program website</a> for details and status updates.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">VISIT PROGRAM WEBSITE</a></p>

				<a name="domainemphasistext"></a><h2>Domain Emphasis</h2><p>Domain Emphases give students a grounded understanding of a particular domain of data-intensive research, relevant theory, or an integrative intellectual thread. A Domain Emphasis is comprised of three courses chosen from a list. Each Domain Emphasis is rooted in a lower division course, which is typically also a prerequisite for the upper division courses. </p>
<div>
<p>A Domain Emphasis is not limited to courses that are intended to be specifically for data science. Rather, they should bring the data science student into the context of a domain. That may involve understanding the vocabulary, methods of study, theoretical foundations, or cultural outlook of the domain. The student needs to become able to build the bridges with data science in carrying out the emphasis, rather than expecting each course to do it for them.</p>
<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-cfc44e51-0196-89fb-acce-70cd59eccbc7"><strong>Students</strong></span><strong><span> will select one course from a short list of lower-division prerequisites, and two courses from a list of upper-division courses. The lower division course is a required element of the Domain Emphasis.</span></strong></strong></p>
<h3><span>What to think about when selecting a domain emphasis:</span></h3>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Courses you take for the 7-course L&amp;S Breadth requirement may fulfill the lower-division course for a domain. Even if you don’t yet know which domain to choose, your breadths may work for you for the major as well.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Allow yourself some flexibility—choose three or four upper-division courses from the <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/domain-emphasis" target="_blank">course list</a> that you’d like to take, rather than two, so you can make sure you continue making progress if you are unable to take a particular course.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Be advised that it is important to examine whether seats are typically available in the courses for the domain you select—many courses in other departments have priority enrollment groups.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-091097ae-0197-5735-2227-6c42b68ac383">Some domain emphases are currently undergoing revision and are subject to change. </span>Course lists for each of the domain emphases are available on the <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/domain-emphasis" target="_blank">Data Science program website.</a></p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">Bachelor of Arts (BA)</span></h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">The Data Science Major degree program combines computational and inferential reasoning to draw conclusions based on data about some aspect of the real world. Data scientists come from all walks of life, all areas of study, and all backgrounds. They share an appreciation for the practical use of mathematical and scientific thinking and the power of computing to understand and solve problems for business, research, and societal impact.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">The Data Science Major will equip students to draw sound conclusions from data in context, using knowledge of statistical inference, computational processes, data management strategies, domain knowledge, and theory. Students will learn to carry out analyses of data through the full cycle of the investigative process in scientific and practical contexts. Students will gain an understanding of the human and ethical implications of data analytics and integrate that knowledge in designing and carrying out their work.</span></p>
<p><span>The Data Science major requirements include &quot;Data 8&quot; </span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">(<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=STAT%20C8" title="STAT C8" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'STAT C8');">STAT C8</a></span></span>

<ul>
	<li>Foundations in Mathematics and Computing</li>
	<li>Computational and Inferential Depth</li>
	<li>Modeling, Learning and Decision Making</li>
	<li>Probability</li>
	<li>Human Contexts and Ethics</li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">Domain Emphasis</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">All students will select a Domain Emphasis, a cluster of one lower division course and two upper division courses, that brings them into the context of a domain and allows them </span>to build bridges with data science.</p>
<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">Declaring the Major</span></h3>
<p>Students can apply to declare the Data Science major after completing all the lower-division prerequisites (see the Major Requirements tab). For applicants with prerequisites in progress, applications will be reviewed after the grades for all prerequisites are available.</p>
<p>It is necessary for applicants to achieve a minimum prerequisite grade point average (GPA) in order to declare the Data Science major. Information on this GPA and the process to apply for admission to the major can be found on the <a href="http://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/data-science-ba/declaring" target="_blank">Declaring the Major</a> web page.</p>
<h3><span>Minor Program</span></h3>
<p>We expect that a minor in Data Science will be available to students from all Colleges, except for students with a Data Science major. The proposal for the minor program is currently in development. <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Check the Data Science program website</a> for details and status updates.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">VISIT PROGRAM WEBSITE</a></p>

Please check the</span></span> <a href="http://data.berkeley.edu/degrees">Data Science program website</a> for updates.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>Only one upper-division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs. No more than two upper-division courses can overlap between two majors.</li>
	<li><span>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</span></li>
</ul>

				<a name="domainemphasistext"></a><h2>Domain Emphasis</h2><p>Domain Emphases give students a grounded understanding of a particular domain of data-intensive research, relevant theory, or an integrative intellectual thread. A Domain Emphasis is comprised of three courses chosen from a list. Each Domain Emphasis is rooted in a lower division course, which is typically also a prerequisite for the upper division courses. </p>
<div>
<p>A Domain Emphasis is not limited to courses that are intended to be specifically for data science. Rather, they should bring the data science student into the context of a domain. That may involve understanding the vocabulary, methods of study, theoretical foundations, or cultural outlook of the domain. The student needs to become able to build the bridges with data science in carrying out the emphasis, rather than expecting each course to do it for them.</p>
<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-cfc44e51-0196-89fb-acce-70cd59eccbc7"><strong>Students</strong></span><strong><span> will select one course from a short list of lower-division prerequisites, and two courses from a list of upper-division courses. The lower division course is a required element of the Domain Emphasis.</span></strong></strong></p>
<h3><span>What to think about when selecting a domain emphasis:</span></h3>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Courses you take for the 7-course L&amp;S Breadth requirement may fulfill the lower-division course for a domain. Even if you don’t yet know which domain to choose, your breadths may work for you for the major as well.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Allow yourself some flexibility—choose three or four upper-division courses from the <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/domain-emphasis" target="_blank">course list</a> that you’d like to take, rather than two, so you can make sure you continue making progress if you are unable to take a particular course.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Be advised that it is important to examine whether seats are typically available in the courses for the domain you select—many courses in other departments have priority enrollment groups.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-091097ae-0197-5735-2227-6c42b68ac383">Some domain emphases are currently undergoing revision and are subject to change. </span>Course lists for each of the domain emphases are available on the <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/domain-emphasis" target="_blank">Data Science program website.</a></p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">The Data Science Major degree program combines computational and inferential reasoning to draw conclusions based on data about some aspect of the real world. Data scientists come from all walks of life, all areas of study, and all backgrounds. They share an appreciation for the practical use of mathematical and scientific thinking and the power of computing to understand and solve problems for business, research, and societal impact.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">The Data Science Major will equip students to draw sound conclusions from data in context, using knowledge of statistical inference, computational processes, data management strategies, domain knowledge, and theory. Students will learn to carry out analyses of data through the full cycle of the investigative process in scientific and practical contexts. Students will gain an understanding of the human and ethical implications of data analytics and integrate that knowledge in designing and carrying out their work.</span></p>
<p><span>The Data Science major requirements include &quot;Data 8&quot; </span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">(<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=STAT%20C8" title="STAT C8" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'STAT C8');">STAT C8</a></span></span>
) and &quot;Data 100&quot; (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=COMPSCI%20C100" title="COMPSCI C100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'COMPSCI C100');">COMPSCI C100</a></span>), the core lower-division and upper-division elements of the major, along with courses from each of the following requirement groups:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Foundations in Mathematics and Computing</li>
	<li>Computational and Inferential Depth</li>
	<li>Modeling, Learning and Decision Making</li>
	<li>Probability</li>
	<li>Human Contexts and Ethics</li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">Domain Emphasis</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">All students will select a Domain Emphasis, a cluster of one lower division course and two upper division courses, that brings them into the context of a domain and allows them </span>to build bridges with data science.</p>
<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-7d57c02e-74ec-7e8f-fbf2-86fb60d9ee6f">Declaring the Major</span></h3>
<p>Students can apply to declare the Data Science major after completing all the lower-division prerequisites (see the Major Requirements tab). For applicants with prerequisites in progress, applications will be reviewed after the grades for all prerequisites are available.</p>
<p>It is necessary for applicants to achieve a minimum prerequisite grade point average (GPA) in order to declare the Data Science major. Information on this GPA and the process to apply for admission to the major can be found on the <a href="http://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/data-science-ba/declaring" target="_blank">Declaring the Major</a> web page.</p>
<h3><span>Minor Program</span></h3>
<p>We expect that a minor in Data Science will be available to students from all Colleges, except for students with a Data Science major. The proposal for the minor program is currently in development. <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Check the Data Science program website</a> for details and status updates.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">VISIT PROGRAM WEBSITE</a></p>

Please check the</span></span> <a href="http://data.berkeley.edu/degrees">Data Science program website</a> for updates.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>Only one upper-division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs. No more than two upper-division courses can overlap between two majors.</li>
	<li><span>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</span></li>
</ul>

				<a name="domainemphasistext"></a><h2>Domain Emphasis</h2><p>Domain Emphases give students a grounded understanding of a particular domain of data-intensive research, relevant theory, or an integrative intellectual thread. A Domain Emphasis is comprised of three courses chosen from a list. Each Domain Emphasis is rooted in a lower division course, which is typically also a prerequisite for the upper division courses. </p>
<div>
<p>A Domain Emphasis is not limited to courses that are intended to be specifically for data science. Rather, they should bring the data science student into the context of a domain. That may involve understanding the vocabulary, methods of study, theoretical foundations, or cultural outlook of the domain. The student needs to become able to build the bridges with data science in carrying out the emphasis, rather than expecting each course to do it for them.</p>
<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-cfc44e51-0196-89fb-acce-70cd59eccbc7"><strong>Students</strong></span><strong><span> will select one course from a short list of lower-division prerequisites, and two courses from a list of upper-division courses. The lower division course is a required element of the Domain Emphasis.</span></strong></strong></p>
<h3><span>What to think about when selecting a domain emphasis:</span></h3>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Courses you take for the 7-course L&amp;S Breadth requirement may fulfill the lower-division course for a domain. Even if you don’t yet know which domain to choose, your breadths may work for you for the major as well.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Allow yourself some flexibility—choose three or four upper-division courses from the <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/domain-emphasis" target="_blank">course list</a> that you’d like to take, rather than two, so you can make sure you continue making progress if you are unable to take a particular course.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Be advised that it is important to examine whether seats are typically available in the courses for the domain you select—many courses in other departments have priority enrollment groups.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-091097ae-0197-5735-2227-6c42b68ac383">Some domain emphases are currently undergoing revision and are subject to change. </span>Course lists for each of the domain emphases are available on the <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/domain-emphasis" target="_blank">Data Science program website.</a></p>
