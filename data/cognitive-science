				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p><span>Cognitive Science is the cross-disciplinary study of the structure and processes of human cognition and their computational simulation or modeling. This interdisciplinary program is designed to give students an understanding of questions dealing with human cognition, such as concept formation, visual perception, the acquisition and processing of natural language, and human reasoning and problem-solving.</span></p>
<p>The program draws on relevant courses found within the fields of anthropology, biology, computer science, education, linguistics, philosophy, and psychology, as well as specially designed lower and upper division courses in cognitive science. </p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>For prerequisites required before declaring the major, please see the Major Requirements tab. Students interested in the major should consult the <a href="http://cogsci.berkeley.edu/">Cognitive Science website</a> and then <a href="http://cogsci.berkeley.edu/contact-information">schedule an appointment with the student academic advisor</a>.  The Cognitive Science office is located in 140 Stephens Hall.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Cognitive Science majors who wish to graduate with honors must have an overall GPA of 3.30 or higher in all work completed at the University and a 3.30 GPA or higher in the major program at the time of graduation. In addition, they must complete a thesis of high quality, based upon independent study with a member of the Cognitive Science faculty and marked by satisfactory completion of at least three units in any of the following courses: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=COG%20SCI%20H195A" title="COG SCI H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'COG SCI H195A');">COG SCI H195A</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=COG%20SCI%20H195B" title="COG SCI H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'COG SCI H195B');">COG SCI H195B</a></span>, or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=COG%20SCI%20199" title="COG SCI 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'COG SCI 199');">COG SCI 199</a></span>.  Please visit the <a href="http://cogsci.berkeley.edu/honors">Cognitive Science Honors webpage for more information</a>.</p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Cognitive Science is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry that is concerned with the acquisition, representation, and use of knowledge by individual minds, brains, and machines, as well as groups, institutions, and other social entities. Because the fundamental purpose of the University, as a social institution, is the preservation, generation, and transmission of knowledge, cognitive science speaks to the heart of the University's mission. By engaging faculty from psychology, philosophy, linguistics, computer science, neuroscience, and anthropology, sociology, and other social sciences in common purpose, cognitive science constitutes a microcosm of the University as a whole. Berkeley's Cognitive Science Program is almost unique in terms of the scope of our approach to the field.</p>
<p>Cognitive Science major students are expected to approach problems of knowledge using the tools of several different disciplines: philosophy, psychology, linguistics, computer science, neuroscience, and various social sciences. This expectation is reflected in a demanding curriculum that moves from a broad introductory survey course (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=COG%20SCI%201" title="COG SCI 1" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'COG SCI 1');">COG SCI 1</a></span>), to a six-course distribution requirement covering the philosophy of mind, cognitive psychology, linguistics, computational modeling and artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and various social sciences. After fulfilling their distribution requirement, students have the opportunity to concentrate further study in one of these six fields, and to complete an honors thesis.</p>

<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>By the end of their undergraduate careers, cognitive science majors are expected to understand and critically evaluate:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Research and theory in cognitive psychology, including perception, attention, learning, memory, reasoning, problem-solving, judgment, and decision-making.</li>
	<li>Research and theory in linguistics, with special attention to the relation between language and thought.</li>
	<li>Various approaches to artificial intelligence, and the computational modeling of cognitive processes.</li>
	<li>The biological bases of cognitive functions, as uncovered by cognitive neuroscience.</li>
	<li>Classic and contemporary work on the philosophy of mind, including the mind-body problem, mental causation, freedom of the will, and the nature of consciousness.</li>
	<li>The sociocultural context of individual cognition, including the social construction and organization of knowledge, cultural differences in cognition, the history of information, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>We also expect that students will have acquired the following skills for lifelong learning and effective citizenship:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Formulating a well-organized argument supported by evidence.</li>
	<li>Effectively written, spoken, and graphical communication.</li>
	<li>Problem-solving in cognitive science and its constituent fields.</li>
	<li>Applying critical thinking skills in new and complex situations.</li>
	<li>Using probability and statistics in reasoning.</li>
	<li>Understanding the social implications of theory and research in cognitive science for responsible professional, civic, and ethical behavior.</li>
</ol>

<p>Cognitive Science does not have a graduate program at UC, Berkeley. The cognitive science research community at Berkeley is centered around the <a href="http://icbs.berkeley.edu/" target="blank">Institute of Cognitive and Brain Sciences</a>. Students interested in cognitive science graduate study can receive graduate training in programs in affiliated disciplines, e.g., <a href="http://psychology.berkeley.edu/" target="blank">psychology</a>, <a href="http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/" target="blank">linguistics</a>, <a href="http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/" target="blank">neuroscience</a>. There is presently no separate graduate program specifically for cognitive science. We are exploring the possibility of starting a cognitive science graduate program in the near future.</p>
<h3>Honors</h3>
<p>Students with a 3.3 grade point average overall and in the upper division major courses may apply for admission to the honors program in their senior year. The awarding of honors is contingent upon submission of a thesis of high quality, based upon independent study with a member of the Cognitive Science faculty and marked by satisfactory completion of at least 3 and at most 6 units of course H195A, H195B or 199. Evaluation of the thesis is the responsibility of, first, the faculty supervisor and then of the second reader, both secured by the student. It is the responsibility of the supervisor and the second reader to decide (1) whether the thesis is of honors quality and (2) if of honors quality, which level of honors is to be assigned: Honors, High Honors, or Highest Honors.  Please see the <a href="http://cogsci.berkeley.edu/honors">Cognitive Science program's Honors page for additional details.</a></p>
<h3>Student Association</h3>
<p>The Cognitive Science Student Association (CSSA) is a great resource for students interested in Cognitive Science. About the CSSA, from their website: <em>The CSSA regularly coordinates academic events such as guest lectures and information sessions; plans social events like professor-student dinners and cog sci themed gatherings; and works with cognitive science faculty and university officials to provide assistance for students. Additionally, the CSSA teaches its own decal on research methodology, has an academic outreach program, and organizes the annual California Cognitive Science Conference.</em>  <a href="http://cssa.berkeley.edu/index.html">Click here to visit the CSSA website.</a></p>

The psychological and neurological processing related to language helps to show the nature of the human mind in comparison to others, the unique variety of cognition that language serves, and the relation of that type of cognition to other types. This not only helps to reveal various forms of cognition but also how those forms relate in human, as well as non-human, minds. To do this we will ask:<br/>
1) What is language as a system and behavior of humankind?<br/>
2) Where is the knowledge of language from?<br/>
3) How is language acquired, processed, and lost in the human brain?<br/>
4) What do the empirical results and the history of linguistic studies that we cover reveal about how we think about language and, by implication, human beings themselves.<br/></p></div>

Scientific and technology (imaging) developments now enable neuroscientists to view, investigate, measure</span><span class="deschide">, and influence the brain directly. An understanding of both structure and function then advances our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in cognitive processes underlying neural systems.

Understanding disease states constitutes an important aspect of this course. Brain disorders change the neural circuits in the brain and cause it to malfunction during basic cognitive processes, such as memory and attention. We will compare how healthy neural circuits are functioning and draw inferences about the biological basis of the impacted cognitive processes.</p></div>

Do you have a self or are you one? How is the self related to brain structure and function? Is the self, for example, identical to some part of the brain or part of the brain’s function? Can you damage the self by damaging the brain? In this course we will look at these questions from conceptual, psychological, and neuroscientific perspectives.

This class is on the cognitive unconsciousness. This is the unconscious mind from a cognitive science point of view rather than one from psychoanalysis (though we will briefly touch on the psychoanalytic notions of the unconscious to clarify the distinction). The basic guide will be asking whether there is explanatory value to explaining human behavior with mental states or events that are not conscious to the person who has them. We say, for</span><span class="deschide"> example, that a person flinched because they felt pain. Pain is a mental state that can explain the behavior (the flinch) of the person.
