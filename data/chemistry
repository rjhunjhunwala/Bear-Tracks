				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>UC Berkeley offers two bachelors' degrees in Chemistry: a Bachelor of Science (BS) through the College of Chemistry and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) through the College of Letters and Science. For specific information regarding degree requirements for each, please refer to the information below, and the appropriate Major Requirements and College Requirements tabs on this page.</p>
<h3>BS in Chemistry, College of Chemistry</h3>
<p>The BS in Chemistry degree provides a strong foundation in experimental processes, instrumentation, and quantitative analysis. Students will also acquire a strong foundation in maths and physics, having taken the higher level sequences of these courses.</p>
<p>The BS in Chemistry is intended for students who are primarily interested in careers as professional chemists (e.g. in environmental, pharmaceutical, materials, and industrial chemistry), or wish to have a thorough grounding in chemistry in preparation for professional or graduate <span class="il">school</span> in chemistry, a scientific career in government or industry, a teaching career, or related career tracks. Students in the BS program may also choose to pursue the Materials Chemistry concentration.</p>
<h3>BA in Chemistry, College of Letters &amp; Science</h3>
<p>The BA in Chemistry includes a greater number of humanities and social science courses than the Bachelor of Science degree and is intended for those interested in careers in teaching, medicine, or other sciences in which a basic understanding of chemical processes is necessary.</p>
<p>Students who want to pursue the BA should apply for admission to the College of Letters &amp; Science.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The College of Chemistry offers a minor in Chemistry. Chemical biology majors are not eligible to pursue this minor. Students must submit a notification of completion of the minor to the College of Chemistry Undergraduate Advising Office.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://chem.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementsbsdegreetext"></a><h2>Major Requirements (BS)</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in all courses undertaken at UC Berkeley, including those from UC Summer Sessions, UC Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley in Washington Program, and XB courses from University Extension.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in all courses taken in the college is required in order to advance and continue in upper division courses.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in all upper division courses taken at the University is required to satisfy major requirements.</li>
	<li>Chemistry majors who receive a grade of D+ or lower in a chemistry course for which a grade of C- or higher is required must repeat the course at UC Berkeley.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding grade requirements in specific courses, please see the notes sections below.</p>
<p>For information regarding residence requirements and unit requirements, please see the College Requirements tab.</p>
<p>Please note, the Academic Guide is updated once a year. For the most up to date requirements information, please take a look at the College of Chemistry <a href="https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/ugrad/degrees/chem" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Students must consult with their college/school for information regarding overlap of courses between their majors and minors.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Two semesters of organic chemistry (Chem 3A/L &amp; 3B/L or Chem 12A &amp; 12B)</li>
	<li>Chem 120A, 120B, Chem C130, or Chem 130B (physical or biophysical chemistry)</li>
	<li>Chem 103 or 104A (inorganic chemistry)</li>
	<li>Two additional upper division Chemistry courses taken at Berkeley, excluding courses numbered 190-199;  the two additional courses may be graduate level but will need to be the entire module ABC to satisfy the requirement.</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Chemistry major provides training for students planning careers in the chemical sciences and also for those whose interests lie in biology, medicine, earth sciences, secondary education, business, and law. More than half of the total Berkeley undergraduate population will, at some stage of their degree program, take a course from the Department of Chemistry. The curriculum of the department is designed to satisfy the diverse needs of all these students.</p>
<p>Each Chemistry graduate will have completed an integrated, rigorous program which includes foundational course work in chemistry and in-depth course work in chemistry or chemistry-related fields. The ACS-certified degree further emphasizes laboratory experience and the development of professional skills. Advanced coursework and educational activities outside the traditional classroom, such as independent research, provide students the opportunity to conduct individual research projects or participate as a member of a research team. Many undergraduate students also benefit from taking our graduate courses in synthetic and physical chemistry.</p>
<p>At graduation, Chemistry majors will have a set of fundamental competencies that are knowledge-based, performance/skills-based, and effective.  </p>
<h3>Learning Goals of the Major</h3>
<p>Graduates will be able to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Master a broad set of chemical knowledge concerning the fundamentals in the basic areas of the discipline (organic, inorganic, analytical, physical, and biological chemistry).</li>
	<li>Solve problems competently by identifying the essential parts of a problem and formulating a strategy for solving the problem. They will be able to rationally estimate the solution to a problem, apply appropriate techniques to arrive at a solution, test the correctness of the solution, and interpret their results.</li>
	<li>Use computers in data acquisition and processing and use available software as a tool in data analysis.</li>
	<li>Employ modern library search tools to locate and retrieve scientific information about a topic, chemical, chemical technique, or an issue relating to chemistry.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Graduates will demonstrate the ability to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Understand the objective of their chemical experiments, properly carry out the experiments, and appropriately record and analyze the results. </li>
	<li>Use standard laboratory equipment, modern instrumentation, and classical techniques to carry out experiments. </li>
	<li>Know and follow the proper procedures and regulations for safe handling and use of chemicals. </li>
	<li>Communicate the concepts and results of their laboratory experiments through effective writing and oral communication skills. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Effective</h3>
<p>Graduates will be able to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Successfully pursue their career objectives in advanced education in professional and/or graduate schools, in a scientific career in government or industry, in a teaching career in the school systems, or in a related career following graduation. <br/>
	The relationship between the major's core curriculum and student learning outcomes can be seen in the Appendix in Table I.</li>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>UC Berkeley offers two bachelors' degrees in Chemistry: a Bachelor of Science (BS) through the College of Chemistry and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) through the College of Letters and Science. For specific information regarding degree requirements for each, please refer to the information below, and the appropriate Major Requirements and College Requirements tabs on this page.</p>
<h3>BS in Chemistry, College of Chemistry</h3>
<p>The BS in Chemistry degree provides a strong foundation in experimental processes, instrumentation, and quantitative analysis. Students will also acquire a strong foundation in maths and physics, having taken the higher level sequences of these courses.</p>
<p>The BS in Chemistry is intended for students who are primarily interested in careers as professional chemists (e.g. in environmental, pharmaceutical, materials, and industrial chemistry), or wish to have a thorough grounding in chemistry in preparation for professional or graduate <span class="il">school</span> in chemistry, a scientific career in government or industry, a teaching career, or related career tracks. Students in the BS program may also choose to pursue the Materials Chemistry concentration.</p>
<h3>BA in Chemistry, College of Letters &amp; Science</h3>
<p>The BA in Chemistry includes a greater number of humanities and social science courses than the Bachelor of Science degree and is intended for those interested in careers in teaching, medicine, or other sciences in which a basic understanding of chemical processes is necessary.</p>
<p>Students who want to pursue the BA should apply for admission to the College of Letters &amp; Science.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The College of Chemistry offers a minor in Chemistry. Chemical biology majors are not eligible to pursue this minor. Students must submit a notification of completion of the minor to the College of Chemistry Undergraduate Advising Office.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://chem.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementsbsdegreetext"></a><h2>Major Requirements (BS)</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in all courses undertaken at UC Berkeley, including those from UC Summer Sessions, UC Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley in Washington Program, and XB courses from University Extension.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in all courses taken in the college is required in order to advance and continue in upper division courses.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in all upper division courses taken at the University is required to satisfy major requirements.</li>
	<li>Chemistry majors who receive a grade of D+ or lower in a chemistry course for which a grade of C- or higher is required must repeat the course at UC Berkeley.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding grade requirements in specific courses, please see the notes sections below.</p>
<p>For information regarding residence requirements and unit requirements, please see the College Requirements tab.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Students must consult with their college/school for information regarding overlap of courses between their majors and minors.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Two semesters of organic chemistry (Chem 3A/L &amp; 3B/L or Chem 12A &amp; 12B)</li>
	<li>Chem 120A, 120B, Chem C130, or Chem 130B (physical or biophysical chemistry)</li>
	<li>Chem 103 or 104A (inorganic chemistry)</li>
	<li>Two additional upper division Chemistry courses taken at Berkeley, excluding courses numbered 190-199;  the two additional courses may be graduate level but will need to be the entire module ABC to satisfy the requirement.</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Chemistry major provides training for students planning careers in the chemical sciences and also for those whose interests lie in biology, medicine, earth sciences, secondary education, business, and law. More than half of the total Berkeley undergraduate population will, at some stage of their degree program, take a course from the Department of Chemistry. The curriculum of the department is designed to satisfy the diverse needs of all these students.</p>
<p>Each Chemistry graduate will have completed an integrated, rigorous program which includes foundational course work in chemistry and in-depth course work in chemistry or chemistry-related fields. The ACS-certified degree further emphasizes laboratory experience and the development of professional skills. Advanced coursework and educational activities outside the traditional classroom, such as independent research, provide students the opportunity to conduct individual research projects or participate as a member of a research team. Many undergraduate students also benefit from taking our graduate courses in synthetic and physical chemistry.</p>
<p>At graduation, Chemistry majors will have a set of fundamental competencies that are knowledge-based, performance/skills-based, and effective.  </p>
<h3>Learning Goals of the Major</h3>
<p>Graduates will be able to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Master a broad set of chemical knowledge concerning the fundamentals in the basic areas of the discipline (organic, inorganic, analytical, physical, and biological chemistry).</li>
	<li>Solve problems competently by identifying the essential parts of a problem and formulating a strategy for solving the problem. They will be able to rationally estimate the solution to a problem, apply appropriate techniques to arrive at a solution, test the correctness of the solution, and interpret their results.</li>
	<li>Use computers in data acquisition and processing and use available software as a tool in data analysis.</li>
	<li>Employ modern library search tools to locate and retrieve scientific information about a topic, chemical, chemical technique, or an issue relating to chemistry.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Graduates will demonstrate the ability to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Understand the objective of their chemical experiments, properly carry out the experiments, and appropriately record and analyze the results. </li>
	<li>Use standard laboratory equipment, modern instrumentation, and classical techniques to carry out experiments. </li>
	<li>Know and follow the proper procedures and regulations for safe handling and use of chemicals. </li>
	<li>Communicate the concepts and results of their laboratory experiments through effective writing and oral communication skills. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Effective</h3>
<p>Graduates will be able to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Successfully pursue their career objectives in advanced education in professional and/or graduate schools, in a scientific career in government or industry, in a teaching career in the school systems, or in a related career following graduation. <br/>
	The relationship between the major's core curriculum and student learning outcomes can be seen in the Appendix in Table I.</li>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>UC Berkeley offers two bachelors' degrees in Chemistry: a Bachelor of Science (BS) through the College of Chemistry and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) through the College of Letters and Science. For specific information regarding degree requirements for each, please refer to the information below, and the appropriate Major Requirements and College Requirements tabs on this page.</p>
<h3>BS in Chemistry, College of Chemistry</h3>
<p>The BS in Chemistry degree provides a strong foundation in experimental processes, instrumentation, and quantitative analysis. Students will also acquire a strong foundation in maths and physics, having taken the higher level sequences of these courses.</p>
<p>The BS in Chemistry is intended for students who are primarily interested in careers as professional chemists (e.g. in environmental, pharmaceutical, materials, and industrial chemistry), or wish to have a thorough grounding in chemistry in preparation for professional or graduate <span class="il">school</span> in chemistry, a scientific career in government or industry, a teaching career, or related career tracks. Students in the BS program may also choose to pursue the Materials Chemistry concentration.</p>
<h3>BA in Chemistry, College of Letters &amp; Science</h3>
<p>The BA in Chemistry includes a greater number of humanities and social science courses than the Bachelor of Science degree and is intended for those interested in careers in teaching, medicine, or other sciences in which a basic understanding of chemical processes is necessary.</p>
<p>Students who want to pursue the BA should apply for admission to the College of Letters &amp; Science.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The College of Chemistry offers a minor in Chemistry. Chemical biology majors are not eligible to pursue this minor. Students must submit a notification of completion of the minor to the College of Chemistry Undergraduate Advising Office.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://chem.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementsbsdegreetext"></a><h2>Major Requirements (BS)</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in all courses undertaken at UC Berkeley, including those from UC Summer Sessions, UC Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley in Washington Program, and XB courses from University Extension.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in all courses taken in the college is required in order to advance and continue in upper division courses.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in all upper division courses taken at the University is required to satisfy major requirements.</li>
	<li>Chemistry majors who receive a grade of D+ or lower in a chemistry course for which a grade of C- or higher is required must repeat the course at UC Berkeley.</li>
</ol>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Students must consult with their college/school for information regarding overlap of courses between their majors and minors.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Two semesters of organic chemistry (Chem 3A/L &amp; 3B/L or Chem 12A &amp; 12B)</li>
	<li>Chem 120A, 120B, Chem C130, or Chem 130B (physical or biophysical chemistry)</li>
	<li>Chem 103 or 104A (inorganic chemistry)</li>
	<li>Two additional upper division Chemistry courses taken at Berkeley, excluding courses numbered 190-199;  the two additional courses may be graduate level but will need to be the entire module ABC to satisfy the requirement.</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Chemistry major provides training for students planning careers in the chemical sciences and also for those whose interests lie in biology, medicine, earth sciences, secondary education, business, and law. More than half of the total Berkeley undergraduate population will, at some stage of their degree program, take a course from the Department of Chemistry. The curriculum of the department is designed to satisfy the diverse needs of all these students.</p>
<p>Each Chemistry graduate will have completed an integrated, rigorous program which includes foundational course work in chemistry and in-depth course work in chemistry or chemistry-related fields. The ACS-certified degree further emphasizes laboratory experience and the development of professional skills. Advanced coursework and educational activities outside the traditional classroom, such as independent research, provide students the opportunity to conduct individual research projects or participate as a member of a research team. Many undergraduate students also benefit from taking our graduate courses in synthetic and physical chemistry.</p>
<p>At graduation, Chemistry majors will have a set of fundamental competencies that are knowledge-based, performance/skills-based, and effective.  </p>
<h3>Learning Goals of the Major</h3>
<p>Graduates will be able to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Master a broad set of chemical knowledge concerning the fundamentals in the basic areas of the discipline (organic, inorganic, analytical, physical, and biological chemistry).</li>
	<li>Solve problems competently by identifying the essential parts of a problem and formulating a strategy for solving the problem. They will be able to rationally estimate the solution to a problem, apply appropriate techniques to arrive at a solution, test the correctness of the solution, and interpret their results.</li>
	<li>Use computers in data acquisition and processing and use available software as a tool in data analysis.</li>
	<li>Employ modern library search tools to locate and retrieve scientific information about a topic, chemical, chemical technique, or an issue relating to chemistry.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Graduates will demonstrate the ability to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Understand the objective of their chemical experiments, properly carry out the experiments, and appropriately record and analyze the results. </li>
	<li>Use standard laboratory equipment, modern instrumentation, and classical techniques to carry out experiments. </li>
	<li>Know and follow the proper procedures and regulations for safe handling and use of chemicals. </li>
	<li>Communicate the concepts and results of their laboratory experiments through effective writing and oral communication skills. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Effective</h3>
<p>Graduates will be able to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Successfully pursue their career objectives in advanced education in professional and/or graduate schools, in a scientific career in government or industry, in a teaching career in the school systems, or in a related career following graduation. <br/>
	The relationship between the major's core curriculum and student learning outcomes can be seen in the Appendix in Table I.</li>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>UC Berkeley offers two bachelors' degrees in Chemistry: a Bachelor of Science (BS) through the College of Chemistry and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) through the College of Letters and Science. For specific information regarding degree requirements for each, please refer to the information below, and the appropriate Major Requirements and College Requirements tabs on this page.</p>
<h3>BS in Chemistry, College of Chemistry</h3>
<p>The BS in Chemistry degree provides a strong foundation in experimental processes, instrumentation, and quantitative analysis. Students will also acquire a strong foundation in maths and physics, having taken the higher level sequences of these courses.</p>
<p>The BS in Chemistry is intended for students who are primarily interested in careers as professional chemists (e.g. in environmental, pharmaceutical, materials, and industrial chemistry), or wish to have a thorough grounding in chemistry in preparation for professional or graduate <span class="il">school</span> in chemistry, a scientific career in government or industry, a teaching career, or related career tracks. Students in the BS program may also choose to pursue the Materials Chemistry concentration.</p>
<h3>BA in Chemistry, College of Letters &amp; Science</h3>
<p>The BA in Chemistry includes a greater number of humanities and social science courses than the Bachelor of Science degree and is intended for those interested in careers in teaching, medicine, or other sciences in which a basic understanding of chemical processes is necessary.</p>
<p>Students who want to pursue the BA should apply for admission to the College of Letters &amp; Science.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The College of Chemistry offers a minor in Chemistry. Chemical biology majors are not eligible to pursue this minor. Students must submit a notification of completion of the minor to the College of Chemistry Undergraduate Advising Office.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://chem.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementsbsdegreetext"></a><h2>Major Requirements (BS)</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in all courses undertaken at UC Berkeley, including those from UC Summer Sessions, UC Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley in Washington Program, and XB courses from University Extension.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in all courses taken in the college is required in order to advance and continue in upper division courses.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in all upper division courses taken at the University is required to satisfy major requirements.</li>
	<li>Chemistry majors who receive a grade of D+ or lower in a chemistry course for which a grade of C- or higher is required must repeat the course at UC Berkeley.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding grade requirements in specific courses, please see the notes sections below.</p>
<p>For information regarding residence requirements and unit requirements, please see the College Requirements tab.</p>
<p>Please note, the Academic Guide is updated once a year. For the most up to date requirements information, please take a look at the College of Chemistry <a href="https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/ugrad/degrees/chem" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Students must consult with their college/school for information regarding overlap of courses between their majors and minors.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Two semesters of organic chemistry (Chem 3A/L &amp; 3B/L or Chem 12A &amp; 12B)</li>
	<li>Chem 120A, 120B, Chem C130, or Chem 130B (physical or biophysical chemistry)</li>
	<li>Chem 103 or 104A (inorganic chemistry)</li>
	<li>Two additional upper division Chemistry courses taken at Berkeley, excluding courses numbered 190-199;  the two additional courses may be graduate level but will need to be the entire module ABC to satisfy the requirement.</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Chemistry major provides training for students planning careers in the chemical sciences and also for those whose interests lie in biology, medicine, earth sciences, secondary education, business, and law. More than half of the total Berkeley undergraduate population will, at some stage of their degree program, take a course from the Department of Chemistry. The curriculum of the department is designed to satisfy the diverse needs of all these students.</p>
<p>Each Chemistry graduate will have completed an integrated, rigorous program which includes foundational course work in chemistry and in-depth course work in chemistry or chemistry-related fields. The ACS-certified degree further emphasizes laboratory experience and the development of professional skills. Advanced coursework and educational activities outside the traditional classroom, such as independent research, provide students the opportunity to conduct individual research projects or participate as a member of a research team. Many undergraduate students also benefit from taking our graduate courses in synthetic and physical chemistry.</p>
<p>At graduation, Chemistry majors will have a set of fundamental competencies that are knowledge-based, performance/skills-based, and effective.  </p>
<h3>Learning Goals of the Major</h3>
<p>Graduates will be able to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Master a broad set of chemical knowledge concerning the fundamentals in the basic areas of the discipline (organic, inorganic, analytical, physical, and biological chemistry).</li>
	<li>Solve problems competently by identifying the essential parts of a problem and formulating a strategy for solving the problem. They will be able to rationally estimate the solution to a problem, apply appropriate techniques to arrive at a solution, test the correctness of the solution, and interpret their results.</li>
	<li>Use computers in data acquisition and processing and use available software as a tool in data analysis.</li>
	<li>Employ modern library search tools to locate and retrieve scientific information about a topic, chemical, chemical technique, or an issue relating to chemistry.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Graduates will demonstrate the ability to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Understand the objective of their chemical experiments, properly carry out the experiments, and appropriately record and analyze the results. </li>
	<li>Use standard laboratory equipment, modern instrumentation, and classical techniques to carry out experiments. </li>
	<li>Know and follow the proper procedures and regulations for safe handling and use of chemicals. </li>
	<li>Communicate the concepts and results of their laboratory experiments through effective writing and oral communication skills. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Effective</h3>
<p>Graduates will be able to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Successfully pursue their career objectives in advanced education in professional and/or graduate schools, in a scientific career in government or industry, in a teaching career in the school systems, or in a related career following graduation. <br/>
	The relationship between the major's core curriculum and student learning outcomes can be seen in the Appendix in Table I.</li>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>UC Berkeley offers two bachelors' degrees in Chemistry: a Bachelor of Science (BS) through the College of Chemistry and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) through the College of Letters and Science. For specific information regarding degree requirements for each, please refer to the information below, and the appropriate Major Requirements and College Requirements tabs on this page.</p>
<h3>BS in Chemistry, College of Chemistry</h3>
<p>The BS in Chemistry degree provides a strong foundation in experimental processes, instrumentation, and quantitative analysis. Students will also acquire a strong foundation in maths and physics, having taken the higher level sequences of these courses.</p>
<p>The BS in Chemistry is intended for students who are primarily interested in careers as professional chemists (e.g. in environmental, pharmaceutical, materials, and industrial chemistry), or wish to have a thorough grounding in chemistry in preparation for professional or graduate <span class="il">school</span> in chemistry, a scientific career in government or industry, a teaching career, or related career tracks. Students in the BS program may also choose to pursue the Materials Chemistry concentration.</p>
<h3>BA in Chemistry, College of Letters &amp; Science</h3>
<p>The BA in Chemistry includes a greater number of humanities and social science courses than the Bachelor of Science degree and is intended for those interested in careers in teaching, medicine, or other sciences in which a basic understanding of chemical processes is necessary.</p>
<p>Students who want to pursue the BA should apply for admission to the College of Letters &amp; Science.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The College of Chemistry offers a minor in Chemistry. Chemical biology majors are not eligible to pursue this minor. Students must submit a notification of completion of the minor to the College of Chemistry Undergraduate Advising Office.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://chem.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementsbsdegreetext"></a><h2>Major Requirements (BS)</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in all courses undertaken at UC Berkeley, including those from UC Summer Sessions, UC Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley in Washington Program, and XB courses from University Extension.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in all courses taken in the college is required in order to advance and continue in upper division courses.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in all upper division courses taken at the University is required to satisfy major requirements.</li>
	<li>Chemistry majors who receive a grade of D+ or lower in a chemistry course for which a grade of C- or higher is required must repeat the course at UC Berkeley.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding grade requirements in specific courses, please see the notes sections below.</p>
<p>For information regarding residence requirements and unit requirements, please see the College Requirements tab.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Students must consult with their college/school for information regarding overlap of courses between their majors and minors.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Two semesters of organic chemistry (Chem 3A/L &amp; 3B/L or Chem 12A &amp; 12B)</li>
	<li>Chem 120A, 120B, Chem C130, or Chem 130B (physical or biophysical chemistry)</li>
	<li>Chem 103 or 104A (inorganic chemistry)</li>
	<li>Two additional upper division Chemistry courses taken at Berkeley, excluding courses numbered 190-199;  the two additional courses may be graduate level but will need to be the entire module ABC to satisfy the requirement.</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Chemistry major provides training for students planning careers in the chemical sciences and also for those whose interests lie in biology, medicine, earth sciences, secondary education, business, and law. More than half of the total Berkeley undergraduate population will, at some stage of their degree program, take a course from the Department of Chemistry. The curriculum of the department is designed to satisfy the diverse needs of all these students.</p>
<p>Each Chemistry graduate will have completed an integrated, rigorous program which includes foundational course work in chemistry and in-depth course work in chemistry or chemistry-related fields. The ACS-certified degree further emphasizes laboratory experience and the development of professional skills. Advanced coursework and educational activities outside the traditional classroom, such as independent research, provide students the opportunity to conduct individual research projects or participate as a member of a research team. Many undergraduate students also benefit from taking our graduate courses in synthetic and physical chemistry.</p>
<p>At graduation, Chemistry majors will have a set of fundamental competencies that are knowledge-based, performance/skills-based, and effective.  </p>
<h3>Learning Goals of the Major</h3>
<p>Graduates will be able to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Master a broad set of chemical knowledge concerning the fundamentals in the basic areas of the discipline (organic, inorganic, analytical, physical, and biological chemistry).</li>
	<li>Solve problems competently by identifying the essential parts of a problem and formulating a strategy for solving the problem. They will be able to rationally estimate the solution to a problem, apply appropriate techniques to arrive at a solution, test the correctness of the solution, and interpret their results.</li>
	<li>Use computers in data acquisition and processing and use available software as a tool in data analysis.</li>
	<li>Employ modern library search tools to locate and retrieve scientific information about a topic, chemical, chemical technique, or an issue relating to chemistry.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Graduates will demonstrate the ability to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Understand the objective of their chemical experiments, properly carry out the experiments, and appropriately record and analyze the results. </li>
	<li>Use standard laboratory equipment, modern instrumentation, and classical techniques to carry out experiments. </li>
	<li>Know and follow the proper procedures and regulations for safe handling and use of chemicals. </li>
	<li>Communicate the concepts and results of their laboratory experiments through effective writing and oral communication skills. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Effective</h3>
<p>Graduates will be able to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Successfully pursue their career objectives in advanced education in professional and/or graduate schools, in a scientific career in government or industry, in a teaching career in the school systems, or in a related career following graduation. <br/>
	The relationship between the major's core curriculum and student learning outcomes can be seen in the Appendix in Table I.</li>
