				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Sociology is an exciting degree that allows its students to pursue a multiplicity of careers and interests. With access to world-renowned faculty and one of the best graduate programs in sociology, undergraduates have a unique opportunity to engage in a lively academic environment.</p>
<p>Students intending to major in sociology are advised to prepare themselves by taking background work in such other areas as history, philosophy, cultural anthropology, psychology, economics, and political science.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students are eligible to declare if they have a 2.0 cumulative and major grade point average (GPA) with at least one course completed in the major, and they have completed (or are in progress to complete) the prerequisites. For information regarding the prerequisites, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>It is recommended that students officially declare as soon as they are ready to do so. They may declare any time.</p>
<p>Once the prerequisites are completed or are in progress, complete the necessary paperwork, and bring it to the sociology advising offices during drop-in advising hours. The process to declare takes 10-15 minutes. Students must submit the following when they declare:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The completed &quot;Data Sheet for Sociology Majors,&quot; both sides completed before the appointment. This form is <a href="http://sociology.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/documents/student_services/undergrads/UCB_Sociology_DeclarationForm.pdf">here</a>, and it is also available outside 424/426 Barrows Hall. </li>
	<li>A copy of their transcript (unofficial is okay) if they took any of the prerequisites at another college or university.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Majors who enter their senior year with a 3.3 grade point average (GPA) overall and a 3.5 GPA in the major may apply to the honors program, after conferring with a major adviser. Students will be required to submit an acceptable thesis proposal as part of their application and are encouraged to take advanced methods courses, such as <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20105" title="SOCIOL 105" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 105');">SOCIOL 105</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20106" title="SOCIOL 106" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 106');">SOCIOL 106</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20108" title="SOCIOL 108" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 108');">SOCIOL 108</a></span> during their junior year in preparation for conducting research for their honors thesis. Students earn honors by maintaining the minimum GPA for honors and by successfully completing <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20H190A" title="SOCIOL H190A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL H190A');">SOCIOL H190A</a></span>-<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20H190B" title="SOCIOL H190B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL H190B');">SOCIOL H190B</a></span>, Senior Honors Thesis, and Seminar.</p>

			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>Double majors can overlap two upper division courses between Sociology and their second major. Sociology majors who wish to complete a minor can overlap one upper division course between Sociology and the minor. Any exceptions to this policy will be made by the department offering the minor. </li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>

In this course, we trace the history of the American family from the 19th-century farm--in which work, medical care, and entertainment went on--to the smaller, more diverse, and subjectively defined family of the 21st century. We also explore ways in which the family acts as a &quot;shock absorber&quot; of many trends including immigration, the increasing social class divide, and especially the growing domination of the</span><span class="deschide"> marketplace. Finally, we also explore the diversity of family forms associated with social class, ethnicity, and sexual orientation.</span><br/>

Society is ordered by age. Age is not the only ordering dimension of society, but it is a central one. A life course perspective represents a sociological way of understanding how age structures society. Our lives progress through a sequence of socially constructed stages—childhood, adolescence, middle adulthood, and later adulthood. A life course perspective is particularly interested in the rules and norms that govern transitions between these stages.</span><br/>

This course examines how sexual identities, communities, desires, and practices are socially, historically, and culturally constructed. We will look at how people reproduce dominant models of sexuality, as well as how a wide range of people--including lesbians, bisexuals, gay men, transgenderists, and self-described queers--contest the power that operates through dominant models of sexuality. Looking at empirical studies and theoretical texts,</span><span class="deschide"> we will trace the paradigm shift from late 19th century sexology to early 20th century psychoanalysis, through a variety of approaches in the 1960's and 1970's to the feminist and queer theory of recent decades.</span><br/>

When structural barriers get in the way of such human flourishing, we think of them as unjust. Being in good health and of sound mind are two core requirements of a life well-lived. Without them, all other attempts at fair play (such as those in the distribution of income and other valued resources) are likely to fail. It makes good sense, therefore</span><span class="deschide">, to pay close attention to the relationship between health and wealth. Such a study has important scholarly and policy implications.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Sociology is an exciting degree that allows its students to pursue a multiplicity of careers and interests. With access to world-renowned faculty and one of the best graduate programs in sociology, undergraduates have a unique opportunity to engage in a lively academic environment.</p>
<p>Students intending to major in sociology are advised to prepare themselves by taking background work in such other areas as history, philosophy, cultural anthropology, psychology, economics, and political science.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students are eligible to declare if they have a 2.0 cumulative and major grade point average (GPA) with at least one course completed in the major, and they have completed (or are in progress to complete) the prerequisites. For information regarding the prerequisites, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>It is recommended that students officially declare as soon as they are ready to do so. They may declare any time.</p>
<p>Once the prerequisites are completed or are in progress, complete the necessary paperwork, and bring it to the sociology advising offices during drop-in advising hours. The process to declare takes 10-15 minutes. Students must submit the following when they declare:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The completed &quot;Data Sheet for Sociology Majors,&quot; both sides completed before the appointment. This form is <a href="http://sociology.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/documents/student_services/undergrads/UCB_Sociology_DeclarationForm.pdf">here</a>, and it is also available outside 424/426 Barrows Hall. </li>
	<li>A copy of their transcript (unofficial is okay) if they took any of the prerequisites at another college or university.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Majors who enter their senior year with a 3.3 grade point average (GPA) overall and a 3.5 GPA in the major may apply to the honors program, after conferring with a major adviser. Students will be required to submit an acceptable thesis proposal as part of their application and are encouraged to take advanced methods courses, such as <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20105" title="SOCIOL 105" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 105');">SOCIOL 105</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20106" title="SOCIOL 106" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 106');">SOCIOL 106</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20108" title="SOCIOL 108" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 108');">SOCIOL 108</a></span> during their junior year in preparation for conducting research for their honors thesis. Students earn honors by maintaining the minimum GPA for honors and by successfully completing <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20H190A" title="SOCIOL H190A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL H190A');">SOCIOL H190A</a></span>-<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20H190B" title="SOCIOL H190B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL H190B');">SOCIOL H190B</a></span>, Senior Honors Thesis, and Seminar.</p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>Double majors can overlap two upper division courses between Sociology and their second major. Sociology majors who wish to complete a minor can overlap one upper division course between Sociology and the minor. Any exceptions to this policy will be made by the department offering the minor. </li>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-921eb48b-58a1-a500-5e76-79ae6e3a10f8">For students considering graduating in less than four years, it's important to acknowledge the reasons to undertake such a plan of study. While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation. All things considered, please see the tables for three and three and a half year degree options.</span></p>

Society is ordered by age. Age is not the only ordering dimension of society, but it is a central one. A life course perspective represents a sociological way of understanding how age structures society. Our lives progress through a sequence of socially constructed stages—childhood, adolescence, middle adulthood, and later adulthood. A life course perspective is particularly interested in the rules and norms that govern transitions between these stages.</span><br/>

The underlying principle of meritocracy is that everyone should have an equal opportunity to put their life plans in action. When structural barriers get in the way of such human flourishing, we think of them as unjust. Being in good health and of sound mind are two core requirements of a life well-lived. Without them, all other attempts at fair play (such as those in the distribution of income and other valued resources) are likely to fail. It makes good sense, therefore</span><span class="deschide">, to pay close attention to the relationship between health and wealth. Such a study has important scholarly and policy implications. We will participate in precisely this kind of inquiry during the semester. We will ask: What are the social determinants of health?</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Sociology is an exciting degree that allows its students to pursue a multiplicity of careers and interests. With access to world-renowned faculty and one of the best graduate programs in sociology, undergraduates have a unique opportunity to engage in a lively academic environment.</p>
<p>Students intending to major in sociology are advised to prepare themselves by taking background work in such other areas as history, philosophy, cultural anthropology, psychology, economics, and political science.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students are eligible to declare if they have a 2.0 cumulative and major grade point average (GPA) with at least one course completed in the major, and they have completed (or are in progress to complete) the prerequisites. For information regarding the prerequisites, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>It is recommended that students officially declare as soon as they are ready to do so. They may declare any time.</p>
<p>Once the prerequisites are completed or are in progress, complete the necessary paperwork, and bring it to the sociology advising offices during drop-in advising hours. The process to declare takes 10-15 minutes. Students must submit the following when they declare:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The completed &quot;Data Sheet for Sociology Majors,&quot; both sides completed before the appointment. This form is <a href="http://sociology.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/documents/student_services/undergrads/UCB_Sociology_DeclarationForm.pdf">here</a>, and it is also available outside 424/426 Barrows Hall. </li>
	<li>A copy of their transcript (unofficial is okay) if they took any of the prerequisites at another college or university.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Majors who enter their senior year with a 3.3 grade point average (GPA) overall and a 3.5 GPA in the major may apply to the honors program, after conferring with a major adviser. Students will be required to submit an acceptable thesis proposal as part of their application and are encouraged to take advanced methods courses, such as <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20105" title="SOCIOL 105" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 105');">SOCIOL 105</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20106" title="SOCIOL 106" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 106');">SOCIOL 106</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20108" title="SOCIOL 108" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 108');">SOCIOL 108</a></span> during their junior year in preparation for conducting research for their honors thesis. Students earn honors by maintaining the minimum GPA for honors and by successfully completing <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20H190A" title="SOCIOL H190A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL H190A');">SOCIOL H190A</a></span>-<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20H190B" title="SOCIOL H190B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL H190B');">SOCIOL H190B</a></span>, Senior Honors Thesis, and Seminar.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>

			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>Double majors can overlap two upper division courses between Sociology and their second major. Sociology majors who wish to complete a minor can overlap one upper division course between Sociology and the minor. Any exceptions to this policy will be made by the department offering the minor. </li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>

Society is ordered by age. Age is not the only ordering dimension of society, but it is a central one. A life course perspective represents a sociological way of understanding how age structures society.

A life course perspective is particularly interested in the rules and norms that govern transitions between these stages.</span><br/>

This course examines how sexual identities, communities, desires, and practices are socially, historically, and culturally constructed. We will look at how people reproduce dominant models of sexuality, as well as how a wide range of people--including lesbians, bisexuals, gay men, transgenderists, and self-described queers--contest the power that operates through dominant models of sexuality. Looking at empirical studies and theoretical texts,</span><span class="deschide"> we will trace the paradigm shift from late 19th century sexology to early 20th century psychoanalysis, through a variety of approaches in the 1960's and 1970's to the feminist and queer theory of recent decades.</span><br/>

The underlying principle of meritocracy is that everyone should have an equal opportunity to put their life plans in action. When structural barriers get in the way of such human flourishing, we think of them as unjust. Being in good health and of sound mind are two core requirements of a life well-lived. Without them, all other attempts at fair play (such as those in the distribution of income and other valued resources) are likely to fail. It makes good sense, therefore</span><span class="deschide">, to pay close attention to the relationship between health and wealth. Such a study has important scholarly and policy implications.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Sociology is an exciting degree that allows its students to pursue a multiplicity of careers and interests. With access to world-renowned faculty and one of the best graduate programs in sociology, undergraduates have a unique opportunity to engage in a lively academic environment.</p>
<p>Students intending to major in sociology are advised to prepare themselves by taking background work in such other areas as history, philosophy, cultural anthropology, psychology, economics, and political science.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students are eligible to declare if they have a 2.0 cumulative and major grade point average (GPA) with at least one course completed in the major, and they have completed (or are in progress to complete) the prerequisites. For information regarding the prerequisites, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>It is recommended that students officially declare as soon as they are ready to do so. They may declare any time.</p>
<p>Once the prerequisites are completed or are in progress, complete the necessary paperwork, and bring it to the sociology advising offices during drop-in advising hours. The process to declare takes 10-15 minutes. Students must submit the following when they declare:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The completed &quot;Data Sheet for Sociology Majors,&quot; both sides completed before the appointment. This form is <a href="http://sociology.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/documents/student_services/undergrads/UCB_Sociology_DeclarationForm.pdf">here</a>, and it is also available outside 424/426 Barrows Hall. </li>
	<li>A copy of their transcript (unofficial is okay) if they took any of the prerequisites at another college or university.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Majors who enter their senior year with a 3.3 grade point average (GPA) overall and a 3.5 GPA in the major may apply to the honors program, after conferring with a major adviser. Students will be required to submit an acceptable thesis proposal as part of their application and are encouraged to take advanced methods courses, such as <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20105" title="SOCIOL 105" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 105');">SOCIOL 105</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20106" title="SOCIOL 106" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 106');">SOCIOL 106</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20108" title="SOCIOL 108" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 108');">SOCIOL 108</a></span> during their junior year in preparation for conducting research for their honors thesis. Students earn honors by maintaining the minimum GPA for honors and by successfully completing <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20H190A" title="SOCIOL H190A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL H190A');">SOCIOL H190A</a></span>-<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20H190B" title="SOCIOL H190B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL H190B');">SOCIOL H190B</a></span>, Senior Honors Thesis, and Seminar.</p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>Double majors can overlap two upper division courses between Sociology and their second major. Sociology majors who wish to complete a minor can overlap one upper division course between Sociology and the minor. Any exceptions to this policy will be made by the department offering the minor. </li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>

While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation. All things considered, please see the tables for three and three and a half year degree options.</span></p>

Society is ordered by age. Age is not the only ordering dimension of society, but it is a central one. A life course perspective represents a sociological way of understanding how age structures society. Our lives progress through a sequence of socially constructed stages—childhood, adolescence, middle adulthood, and later adulthood. A life course perspective is particularly interested in the rules and norms that govern transitions between these stages.</span><br/>

The underlying principle of meritocracy is that everyone should have an equal opportunity to put their life plans in action. When structural barriers get in the way of such human flourishing, we think of them as unjust. Being in good health and of sound mind are two core requirements of a life well-lived. Without them, all other attempts at fair play (such as those in the distribution of income and other valued resources) are likely to fail. It makes good sense, therefore</span><span class="deschide">, to pay close attention to the relationship between health and wealth. Such a study has important scholarly and policy implications. We will participate in precisely this kind of inquiry during the semester. We will ask: What are the social determinants of health?</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Sociology is an exciting degree that allows its students to pursue a multiplicity of careers and interests. With access to world-renowned faculty and one of the best graduate programs in sociology, undergraduates have a unique opportunity to engage in a lively academic environment.</p>
<p>Students intending to major in sociology are advised to prepare themselves by taking background work in such other areas as history, philosophy, cultural anthropology, psychology, economics, and political science.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students are eligible to declare if they have a 2.0 cumulative and major grade point average (GPA) with at least one course completed in the major, and they have completed (or are in progress to complete) the prerequisites. For information regarding the prerequisites, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>It is recommended that students officially declare as soon as they are ready to do so. They may declare any time.</p>
<p>Once the prerequisites are completed or are in progress, complete the necessary paperwork, and bring it to the sociology advising offices during drop-in advising hours. The process to declare takes 10-15 minutes. Students must submit the following when they declare:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The completed &quot;Data Sheet for Sociology Majors,&quot; both sides completed before the appointment. This form is <a href="http://sociology.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/documents/student_services/undergrads/UCB_Sociology_DeclarationForm.pdf">here</a>, and it is also available outside 424/426 Barrows Hall. </li>
	<li>A copy of their transcript (unofficial is okay) if they took any of the prerequisites at another college or university.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Majors who enter their senior year with a 3.3 grade point average (GPA) overall and a 3.5 GPA in the major may apply to the honors program, after conferring with a major adviser. Students will be required to submit an acceptable thesis proposal as part of their application and are encouraged to take advanced methods courses, such as <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20105" title="SOCIOL 105" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 105');">SOCIOL 105</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20106" title="SOCIOL 106" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 106');">SOCIOL 106</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20108" title="SOCIOL 108" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL 108');">SOCIOL 108</a></span> during their junior year in preparation for conducting research for their honors thesis. Students earn honors by maintaining the minimum GPA for honors and by successfully completing <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20H190A" title="SOCIOL H190A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL H190A');">SOCIOL H190A</a></span>-<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOCIOL%20H190B" title="SOCIOL H190B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOCIOL H190B');">SOCIOL H190B</a></span>, Senior Honors Thesis, and Seminar.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>

			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>Double majors can overlap two upper division courses between Sociology and their second major. Sociology majors who wish to complete a minor can overlap one upper division course between Sociology and the minor. Any exceptions to this policy will be made by the department offering the minor. </li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>

Society is ordered by age. Age is not the only ordering dimension of society, but it is a central one. A life course perspective represents a sociological way of understanding how age structures society.

A life course perspective is particularly interested in the rules and norms that govern transitions between these stages.</span><br/>

This course examines how sexual identities, communities, desires, and practices are socially, historically, and culturally constructed. We will look at how people reproduce dominant models of sexuality, as well as how a wide range of people--including lesbians, bisexuals, gay men, transgenderists, and self-described queers--contest the power that operates through dominant models of sexuality. Looking at empirical studies and theoretical texts,</span><span class="deschide"> we will trace the paradigm shift from late 19th century sexology to early 20th century psychoanalysis, through a variety of approaches in the 1960's and 1970's to the feminist and queer theory of recent decades.</span><br/>

The underlying principle of meritocracy is that everyone should have an equal opportunity to put their life plans in action. When structural barriers get in the way of such human flourishing, we think of them as unjust. Being in good health and of sound mind are two core requirements of a life well-lived. Without them, all other attempts at fair play (such as those in the distribution of income and other valued resources) are likely to fail. It makes good sense, therefore</span><span class="deschide">, to pay close attention to the relationship between health and wealth. Such a study has important scholarly and policy implications.
