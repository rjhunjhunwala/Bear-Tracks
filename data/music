				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Department of Music grants a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Music and also a minor in Music. The department is dedicated to a liberal education in the arts and humanities and thus involves students in all aspects of the study of music-theoretical and creative studies, historical and cultural studies, music and technology, and performance. The curriculum is responsive to the interests of a diverse student body, and the program offers a broad and flexible program.</p>
<p>The major may serve as preprofessional training for the student seeking a career in music or provide a lasting source of enrichment for the student with other career goals. Prospective majors are asked to demonstrate a minimum standard of musical literacy in a placement test. Since the program is offered by a department of music rather than a school of music, a performance audition is not required to declare the major.</p>
<p>There are a large number of double majors in the department representing fields such as molecular and cell biology, rhetoric, physics, theater, dance, and performance studies, political economy of industrial societies, English, and business administration, just to name a few.</p>
<h3>Course of Study Overview</h3>
<p>Lower division studies are intended to provide grounding in the skills of musicianship and harmony and a broad background in the literature and practices of European and a variety of other music. Upper division students may choose from an extensive selection of elective courses to create an individual course of study according to their own interests. The department offers an honors program in which a major in the senior year may develop a special honors project working with a faculty advisor in any area of music studies.</p>
<p>Students without keyboard proficiency are strongly urged to enroll in two semesters of <span class="sc_courseinline">Elementary Piano (<a href="/search/?P=MUSIC%2045M" title="MUSIC 45M" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MUSIC 45M');">MUSIC 45M</a>)</span> in their first semesters in the major program.</p>

<h3>Course Placement Procedure</h3>
<p><span>Students who plan to major in music or wish to take music major classes must complete the Music Placement Procedure before beginning music major classes. Students may pre-enroll in classes before the </span>Musicianship Placement Exam<span> and make adjustments to their schedule during the add/drop period if necessary. For detailed information regarding the placement tests, please see the </span><a href="http://music.berkeley.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate-degree-program/placement-procedure/">Placement Procedure</a><span> page on the department's website.</span></p>
<h3><span>Declaring the Major</span></h3>
<p>To declare the Music Major, prospective students must:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:20px">
	<li>Place into <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MUSIC%2052A" title="MUSIC 52A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MUSIC 52A');">MUSIC 52A</a> Musicianship I</span> or higher via the Musicianship Placement Exam, and enroll in the course of placement.</li>

	<li>Complete courses in at least 3 of the following areas of study, and receive a grade of C or higher in each course:
	<ul style="margin-left:20px">
		<li>Musicianship and Harmony</li>
		<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MUSIC%2070" title="MUSIC 70" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MUSIC 70');">MUSIC 70</a> History of Music I</span></li>

		<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MUSIC%2080" title="MUSIC 80" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MUSIC 80');">MUSIC 80</a> Studies of Musics of the World</span></li>

		<li>Performance</li>
	</ul>

	</li>

</ul>

<p>An Undergraduate Orientation is held once before the beginning of each semester. The orientation reviews important information such as placement exams, major requirements, program planning, major resources, and student life. It is imperative that prospective music majors make every possible effort to attend.</p>
<p>Students should submit the <a href="http://music.berkeley.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate-degree-program/major-declaration/">online major application</a> on the department website, and meet with the Undergraduate Advisor to create a program plan as soon as possible after placement.</p>
<h3><span>Honors Program</span></h3>
<p>The Department of Music offers an individualized program leading to a BA degree with honors. Students with a grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 overall and 3.5 in the major may apply to enroll in the honors program in the last two semesters of their undergraduate study. Under course <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MUSIC%20H195" title="MUSIC H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MUSIC H195');">MUSIC H195</a></span>, students undertake a special project exceeding the scope of regular coursework for one or two semesters. Application forms with more detailed criteria for approval can be obtained from the department office and must be submitted by 12 p.m. on the Friday of the third week of classes in the semester in which the project is started.</p>

<ol>
	<li>To acquire knowledge and understanding of music in an integrated way—through historical and cultural studies, musicianship and theory, and performance. These studies prepare students to pursue a career in some aspect of music or to maintain music as a central part of their lives.</li>
	<li>To cultivate musical competency, including literacy (the use of music notation in reading, performing, composing, analyzing, and hearing music).</li>
	<li>To develop skills of critical thinking and writing about music by taking courses on past and present musical cultures in European and other heritages.</li>
	<li>To create music by performing, composing, and improvising.</li>
	<li><span>To pursue personal interests by selecting upper division courses including independent studies and honors projects.</span></li>

This course is intended, above all else, to create the circumstances in which we will each independently develop as intimate a relationship as we can with Beethoven’s music. With an open mind and a bit of application, we ought to become well-acquainted with several of his compositions, extremely friendly with others, and perhaps even head over heals in love with a couple of them.<br/>
We’ll be seeking to understand this music through attentive listening and close technical</span><span class="deschide"> description, but also by looking at the historical environments in which it was composed, performed, and heard.<br/>
For that reason, we’re going to take a roughly chronological route through Beethoven’s life and works.</span><br />

This course explores the intersections between aesthetic practice and social change. Students will investigate—in both theory and practice—the capacity of art making to cultivate transformation of themselves, their relationships, their practices, their institutions, and the larger economic and socio-political structures in which they function, locally and globally. Focusing on historical and contemporary artists and political issues, we ask:</span><span class="deschide"> 1) How is art impacted by social change? 2) How has art been used toward social change? and 3) How can we, as course participants, use art to bring about social change?</span><br />

A seminar for upper division music majors. The primary purpose of this course is to create an environment in which students can combine the research and analysis of music with live performance. The specific topic covered will change each semester. Class time will be divided equally among (1) historical and analytical readings; (2) discussion and analysis of recorded and live performances; (3) in-class performance. The final project will combine</span><span class="deschide"> scholarly work and performance in the form of a lecture-recital or collaborative creative project.</span><br />
