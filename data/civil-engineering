				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering's (CEE) undergraduate program offers opportunities for rigorous academic learning, fellowship, hands-on experience, and leadership. Classes are relatively small, so students get to know both the faculty and fellow students.</p>
<p>The program in civil and environmental engineering, which is top-ranked nationally, provides students with a strong fundamental background in engineering science, design, and practice. Students learn to solve societal problems—in California, the United States, and the world—such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Improving civil infrastructure</li>
	<li>Protecting resources</li>
	<li>Mitigating hazards</li>
	<li>Creating efficient and sustainable civil systems</li>
</ul>
<p>CEE's four-year curriculum leads to an ABET-accredited Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Civil Engineering. Undergraduates at Berkeley have opportunities for professional interactions and community service. CEE has active student chapters of the American Society of Civil Engineers and the national honor society of Chi Epsilon as well as seven competition teams.</p>
<h3>Areas of Emphasis</h3>
<p>Students with a specific interest within civil engineering may choose to emphasize one of the following areas: engineering and project management; environmental engineering; geosystems; structural engineering, mechanics and materials; or transportation engineering. See <a href="http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/undergrad/curriculum">suggestions </a>for elective courses and the capstone design project.</p>
<p>Selection of an area of emphasis is optional. A BS in engineering is awarded whether or not a student follows the broad and general program or chooses an area of emphasis.</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p><span>The BS program in Civil Engineering is accredited by the </span><a href="http://www.abet.org/accreditation/">Engineering Accreditation Commission of the ABET, Inc.</a></p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few (if any) spaces that open in the college each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">college's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>CEE does not offer a minor in Civil Engineering. Instead, the department offers the following specialized minors:<br/>
<a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/environmental-engineering/">Environmental Engineering</a><br/>
<a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/geosystems/">GeoSystems</a><br/>
<a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/structural-engineering/">Structural Engineering</a></p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>
			</div>
			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All technical courses taken in satisfaction of major requirements must be taken for a letter grade.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for all work undertaken at UC Berkeley.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum GPA of 2.0 is required for all technical courses taken in satisfaction of major requirements.</p>

				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><h3>Faculty Advisers</h3>
<p>Students in CEE are encouraged to seek mentoring from CEE faculty advisers.</p>
<p>Faculty advisers (and, indeed, all faculty members) hold office hours throughout the school year to help students with course content; to advise on courses, career objectives and graduate school; to provide guidance about summer internships; to mentor students researchers; and to write letters of recommendation as appropriate. They also can be contacted (by e-mail or phone) to schedule an appointment. </p>
<p>CEE students should meet with a faculty advisor of their choice at least twice a year for academic advising.  The department hosts Academic Advising Forums each semester to facilitate advising.  The faculty advisor reviews the student's proposed academic schedule, suggests coursework based on the student's interest and offers mentoring for career development.  If a student struggles academically, as evidenced by their GPA, the department will require academic advising prior to enrollment in classes the following semester.</p>
<h3>College of Engineering Advising</h3>
<p>Students are also assigned an engineering student services (ESS) adviser in the College of Engineering. ESS advisers help with a wide range of issues by assisting with course selection and academic decision-making, suggesting enrichment opportunities, explaining graduation requirements and college policies, monitoring progress towards the degree, and providing support or referrals to campus resources to help students reach their academic and personal goals. Explore the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/advising">ESS website</a> for detailed information on advising services.</p>
<h3>Departmental Advising</h3>
<p>CEE's undergraduate adviser answers registration questions, assists with course selection and academic decision-making, describes courses, interprets departmental policy, and makes referrals to resources on campus. The department’s undergraduate adviser is located in the CEE Academic Affairs Office, 750 Davis Hall.</p>

This is an introductory course on the finite element method and is intended for seniors in engineering and applied science disciplines. The course covers the basic topics of finite element technology, including domain discretization, polynomial interpolation, application of boundary conditions, assembly of global arrays, and solution of the resulting algebraic systems. Finite element formulations for several important field equations are introduced</span><span class="deschide"> using both direct and integral approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on computer simulation and analysis of realistic engineering problems from solid and fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetism. The course uses FEMLAB, a multiphysics MATLAB-based finite element program that possesses a wide array of modeling capabilities and is ideally suited for instruction. Assignments will involve both paper- and computer-based exercises. Computer-based assignments will emphasize the practical aspects of finite element model construction and analysis.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering's (CEE) undergraduate program offers opportunities for rigorous academic learning, fellowship, hands-on experience, and leadership. Classes are relatively small, so students get to know both the faculty and fellow students.</p>
<p>The program in civil and environmental engineering, which is top-ranked nationally, provides students with a strong fundamental background in engineering science, design, and practice. Students learn to solve societal problems—in California, the United States, and the world—such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Improving civil infrastructure</li>
	<li>Protecting resources</li>
	<li>Mitigating hazards</li>
	<li>Creating efficient and sustainable civil systems</li>
</ul>
<p>CEE's four-year curriculum leads to an ABET-accredited Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Civil Engineering. Undergraduates at Berkeley have opportunities for professional interactions and community service. CEE has active student chapters of the American Society of Civil Engineers and the national honor society of Chi Epsilon as well as seven competition teams.</p>
<h3>Areas of Emphasis</h3>
<p>Students with a specific interest within civil engineering may choose to emphasize one of the following areas: engineering and project management; environmental engineering; geosystems; structural engineering, mechanics and materials; or transportation engineering. See <a href="http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/undergrad/curriculum">suggestions </a>for elective courses and the capstone design project.</p>
<p>Selection of an area of emphasis is optional. A BS in engineering is awarded whether or not a student follows the broad and general program or chooses an area of emphasis.</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p><span>The BS program in Civil Engineering is accredited by the </span><a href="http://www.abet.org/accreditation/">Engineering Accreditation Commission of the ABET, Inc.</a></p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few (if any) spaces that open in the college each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">college's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>CEE does not offer a minor in Civil Engineering. Instead, the department offers the following specialized minors:<br/>
<a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/environmental-engineering/">Environmental Engineering</a><br/>
<a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/geosystems/">GeoSystems</a><br/>
<a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/structural-engineering/">Structural Engineering</a></p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>
			</div>
			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All technical courses taken in satisfaction of major requirements must be taken for a letter grade.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for all work undertaken at UC Berkeley.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum GPA of 2.0 is required for all technical courses taken in satisfaction of major requirements.</p>
	</li>

				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><h3>Faculty Advisers</h3>
<p>Students in CEE are encouraged to seek mentoring from CEE faculty advisers.</p>
<p>Faculty advisers (and, indeed, all faculty members) hold office hours throughout the school year to help students with course content; to advise on courses, career objectives and graduate school; to provide guidance about summer internships; to mentor students researchers; and to write letters of recommendation as appropriate. They also can be contacted (by e-mail or phone) to schedule an appointment. </p>
<p>CEE students should meet with a faculty advisor of their choice at least twice a year for academic advising.  The department hosts Academic Advising Forums each semester to facilitate advising.  The faculty advisor reviews the student's proposed academic schedule, suggests coursework based on the student's interest and offers mentoring for career development.  If a student struggles academically, as evidenced by their GPA, the department will require academic advising prior to enrollment in classes the following semester.</p>
<h3>College of Engineering Advising</h3>
<p>Students are also assigned an engineering student services (ESS) adviser in the College of Engineering. ESS advisers help with a wide range of issues by assisting with course selection and academic decision-making, suggesting enrichment opportunities, explaining graduation requirements and college policies, monitoring progress towards the degree, and providing support or referrals to campus resources to help students reach their academic and personal goals. Explore the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/advising">ESS website</a> for detailed information on advising services.</p>
<h3>Departmental Advising</h3>
<p>CEE's undergraduate adviser answers registration questions, assists with course selection and academic decision-making, describes courses, interprets departmental policy, and makes referrals to resources on campus. The department’s undergraduate adviser is located in the CEE Academic Affairs Office, 750 Davis Hall.</p>

This is an introductory course on the finite element method and is intended for seniors in engineering and applied science disciplines. The course covers the basic topics of finite element technology, including domain discretization, polynomial interpolation, application of boundary conditions, assembly of global arrays, and solution of the resulting algebraic systems. Finite element formulations for several important field equations are introduced</span><span class="deschide"> using both direct and integral approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on computer simulation and analysis of realistic engineering problems from solid and fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetism. The course uses FEMLAB, a multiphysics MATLAB-based finite element program that possesses a wide array of modeling capabilities and is ideally suited for instruction. Assignments will involve both paper- and computer-based exercises. Computer-based assignments will emphasize the practical aspects of finite element model construction and analysis.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering's (CEE) undergraduate program offers opportunities for rigorous academic learning, fellowship, hands-on experience, and leadership. Classes are relatively small, so students get to know both the faculty and fellow students.</p>
<p>The program in civil and environmental engineering, which is top-ranked nationally, provides students with a strong fundamental background in engineering science, design, and practice. Students learn to solve societal problems—in California, the United States, and the world—such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Improving civil infrastructure</li>
	<li>Protecting resources</li>
	<li>Mitigating hazards</li>
	<li>Creating efficient and sustainable civil systems</li>
</ul>
<p>CEE's four-year curriculum leads to an ABET-accredited Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Civil Engineering. Undergraduates at Berkeley have opportunities for professional interactions and community service. CEE has active student chapters of the American Society of Civil Engineers and the national honor society of Chi Epsilon as well as seven competition teams.</p>
<h3>Areas of Emphasis</h3>
<p>Students with a specific interest within civil engineering may choose to emphasize one of the following areas: engineering and project management; environmental engineering; geosystems; structural engineering, mechanics and materials; or transportation engineering. See <a href="http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/undergrad/curriculum">suggestions </a>for elective courses and the capstone design project.</p>
<p>Selection of an area of emphasis is optional. A BS in engineering is awarded whether or not a student follows the broad and general program or chooses an area of emphasis.</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p><span>The BS program in Civil Engineering is accredited by the </span><a href="http://www.abet.org/accreditation/">Engineering Accreditation Commission of the ABET, Inc.</a></p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few (if any) spaces that open in the college each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">college's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>CEE does not offer a minor in Civil Engineering. Instead, the department offers the following specialized minors:<br/>
<a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/environmental-engineering/">Environmental Engineering</a><br/>
<a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/geosystems/">GeoSystems</a><br/>
<a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/structural-engineering/">Structural Engineering</a></p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>
			</div>
			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All technical courses taken in satisfaction of major requirements must be taken for a letter grade.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for all work undertaken at UC Berkeley.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum GPA of 2.0 is required for all technical courses taken in satisfaction of major requirements.</p>

You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley.

				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><h3>Faculty Advisers</h3>
<p>Students in CEE are encouraged to seek mentoring from CEE faculty advisers.</p>
<p>Faculty advisers (and, indeed, all faculty members) hold office hours throughout the school year to help students with course content; to advise on courses, career objectives and graduate school; to provide guidance about summer internships; to mentor students researchers; and to write letters of recommendation as appropriate. They also can be contacted (by e-mail or phone) to schedule an appointment. </p>
<p>CEE students should meet with a faculty advisor of their choice at least twice a year for academic advising.  The department hosts Academic Advising Forums each semester to facilitate advising.  The faculty advisor reviews the student's proposed academic schedule, suggests coursework based on the student's interest and offers mentoring for career development.  If a student struggles academically, as evidenced by their GPA, the department will require academic advising prior to enrollment in classes the following semester.</p>
<h3>College of Engineering Advising</h3>
<p>Students are also assigned an engineering student services (ESS) adviser in the College of Engineering. ESS advisers help with a wide range of issues by assisting with course selection and academic decision-making, suggesting enrichment opportunities, explaining graduation requirements and college policies, monitoring progress towards the degree, and providing support or referrals to campus resources to help students reach their academic and personal goals. Explore the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/advising">ESS website</a> for detailed information on advising services.</p>
<h3>Departmental Advising</h3>
<p>CEE's undergraduate adviser answers registration questions, assists with course selection and academic decision-making, describes courses, interprets departmental policy, and makes referrals to resources on campus. The department’s undergraduate adviser is located in the CEE Academic Affairs Office, 750 Davis Hall.</p>

This is an introductory course on the finite element method and is intended for seniors in engineering and applied science disciplines. The course covers the basic topics of finite element technology, including domain discretization, polynomial interpolation, application of boundary conditions, assembly of global arrays, and solution of the resulting algebraic systems. Finite element formulations for several important field equations are introduced</span><span class="deschide"> using both direct and integral approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on computer simulation and analysis of realistic engineering problems from solid and fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetism. The course uses FEMLAB, a multiphysics MATLAB-based finite element program that possesses a wide array of modeling capabilities and is ideally suited for instruction. Assignments will involve both paper- and computer-based exercises. Computer-based assignments will emphasize the practical aspects of finite element model construction and analysis.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering's (CEE) undergraduate program offers opportunities for rigorous academic learning, fellowship, hands-on experience, and leadership. Classes are relatively small, so students get to know both the faculty and fellow students.</p>
<p>The program in civil and environmental engineering, which is top-ranked nationally, provides students with a strong fundamental background in engineering science, design, and practice. Students learn to solve societal problems—in California, the United States, and the world—such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Improving civil infrastructure</li>
	<li>Protecting resources</li>
	<li>Mitigating hazards</li>
	<li>Creating efficient and sustainable civil systems</li>
</ul>
<p>CEE's four-year curriculum leads to an ABET-accredited Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Civil Engineering. Undergraduates at Berkeley have opportunities for professional interactions and community service. CEE has active student chapters of the American Society of Civil Engineers and the national honor society of Chi Epsilon as well as seven competition teams.</p>
<h3>Areas of Emphasis</h3>
<p>Students with a specific interest within civil engineering may choose to emphasize one of the following areas: engineering and project management; environmental engineering; geosystems; structural engineering, mechanics and materials; or transportation engineering. See <a href="http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/undergrad/curriculum">suggestions </a>for elective courses and the capstone design project.</p>
<p>Selection of an area of emphasis is optional. A BS in engineering is awarded whether or not a student follows the broad and general program or chooses an area of emphasis.</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p><span>The BS program in Civil Engineering is accredited by the </span><a href="http://www.abet.org/accreditation/">Engineering Accreditation Commission of the ABET, Inc.</a></p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few (if any) spaces that open in the college each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">college's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>CEE does not offer a minor in Civil Engineering. Instead, the department offers the following specialized minors:<br/>
<a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/environmental-engineering/">Environmental Engineering</a><br/>
<a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/geosystems/">GeoSystems</a><br/>
<a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/structural-engineering/">Structural Engineering</a></p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>
			</div>
			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All technical courses taken in satisfaction of major requirements must be taken for a letter grade.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for all work undertaken at UC Berkeley.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum GPA of 2.0 is required for all technical courses taken in satisfaction of major requirements.</p>
	</li>

				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><h3>Faculty Advisers</h3>
<p>Students in CEE are encouraged to seek mentoring from CEE faculty advisers.</p>
<p>Faculty advisers (and, indeed, all faculty members) hold office hours throughout the school year to help students with course content; to advise on courses, career objectives and graduate school; to provide guidance about summer internships; to mentor students researchers; and to write letters of recommendation as appropriate. They also can be contacted (by e-mail or phone) to schedule an appointment. </p>
<p>CEE students should meet with a faculty advisor of their choice at least twice a year for academic advising.  The department hosts Academic Advising Forums each semester to facilitate advising.  The faculty advisor reviews the student's proposed academic schedule, suggests coursework based on the student's interest and offers mentoring for career development.  If a student struggles academically, as evidenced by their GPA, the department will require academic advising prior to enrollment in classes the following semester.</p>
<h3>College of Engineering Advising</h3>
<p>Students are also assigned an engineering student services (ESS) adviser in the College of Engineering. ESS advisers help with a wide range of issues by assisting with course selection and academic decision-making, suggesting enrichment opportunities, explaining graduation requirements and college policies, monitoring progress towards the degree, and providing support or referrals to campus resources to help students reach their academic and personal goals. Explore the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/advising">ESS website</a> for detailed information on advising services.</p>
<h3>Departmental Advising</h3>
<p>CEE's undergraduate adviser answers registration questions, assists with course selection and academic decision-making, describes courses, interprets departmental policy, and makes referrals to resources on campus. The department’s undergraduate adviser is located in the CEE Academic Affairs Office, 750 Davis Hall.</p>

This is an introductory course on the finite element method and is intended for seniors in engineering and applied science disciplines. The course covers the basic topics of finite element technology, including domain discretization, polynomial interpolation, application of boundary conditions, assembly of global arrays, and solution of the resulting algebraic systems. Finite element formulations for several important field equations are introduced</span><span class="deschide"> using both direct and integral approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on computer simulation and analysis of realistic engineering problems from solid and fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetism. The course uses FEMLAB, a multiphysics MATLAB-based finite element program that possesses a wide array of modeling capabilities and is ideally suited for instruction. Assignments will involve both paper- and computer-based exercises. Computer-based assignments will emphasize the practical aspects of finite element model construction and analysis.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering's (CEE) undergraduate program offers opportunities for rigorous academic learning, fellowship, hands-on experience, and leadership. Classes are relatively small, so students get to know both the faculty and fellow students.</p>
<p>The program in civil and environmental engineering, which is top-ranked nationally, provides students with a strong fundamental background in engineering science, design, and practice. Students learn to solve societal problems—in California, the United States, and the world—such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Improving civil infrastructure</li>
	<li>Protecting resources</li>
	<li>Mitigating hazards</li>
	<li>Creating efficient and sustainable civil systems</li>
</ul>
<p>CEE's four-year curriculum leads to an ABET-accredited Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Civil Engineering. Undergraduates at Berkeley have opportunities for professional interactions and community service. CEE has active student chapters of the American Society of Civil Engineers and the national honor society of Chi Epsilon as well as seven competition teams.</p>
<h3>Areas of Emphasis</h3>
<p>Students with a specific interest within civil engineering may choose to emphasize one of the following areas: engineering and project management; environmental engineering; geosystems; structural engineering, mechanics and materials; or transportation engineering. See <a href="http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/undergrad/curriculum">suggestions </a>for elective courses and the capstone design project.</p>
<p>Selection of an area of emphasis is optional. A BS in engineering is awarded whether or not a student follows the broad and general program or chooses an area of emphasis.</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p><span>The BS program in Civil Engineering is accredited by the </span><a href="http://www.abet.org/accreditation/">Engineering Accreditation Commission of the ABET, Inc.</a></p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few (if any) spaces that open in the college each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">college's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>CEE does not offer a minor in Civil Engineering. Instead, the department offers the following specialized minors:<br/>
<a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/environmental-engineering/">Environmental Engineering</a><br/>
<a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/geosystems/">GeoSystems</a><br/>
<a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/structural-engineering/">Structural Engineering</a></p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>
			</div>
			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All technical courses taken in satisfaction of major requirements must be taken for a letter grade.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for all work undertaken at UC Berkeley.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum GPA of 2.0 is required for all technical courses taken in satisfaction of major requirements.</p>

You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley.

				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><h3>Faculty Advisers</h3>
<p>Students in CEE are encouraged to seek mentoring from CEE faculty advisers.</p>
<p>Faculty advisers (and, indeed, all faculty members) hold office hours throughout the school year to help students with course content; to advise on courses, career objectives and graduate school; to provide guidance about summer internships; to mentor students researchers; and to write letters of recommendation as appropriate. They also can be contacted (by e-mail or phone) to schedule an appointment. </p>
<p>CEE students should meet with a faculty advisor of their choice at least twice a year for academic advising.  The department hosts Academic Advising Forums each semester to facilitate advising.  The faculty advisor reviews the student's proposed academic schedule, suggests coursework based on the student's interest and offers mentoring for career development.  If a student struggles academically, as evidenced by their GPA, the department will require academic advising prior to enrollment in classes the following semester.</p>
<h3>College of Engineering Advising</h3>
<p>Students are also assigned an engineering student services (ESS) adviser in the College of Engineering. ESS advisers help with a wide range of issues by assisting with course selection and academic decision-making, suggesting enrichment opportunities, explaining graduation requirements and college policies, monitoring progress towards the degree, and providing support or referrals to campus resources to help students reach their academic and personal goals. Explore the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/advising">ESS website</a> for detailed information on advising services.</p>
<h3>Departmental Advising</h3>
<p>CEE's undergraduate adviser answers registration questions, assists with course selection and academic decision-making, describes courses, interprets departmental policy, and makes referrals to resources on campus. The department’s undergraduate adviser is located in the CEE Academic Affairs Office, 750 Davis Hall.</p>

This is an introductory course on the finite element method and is intended for seniors in engineering and applied science disciplines. The course covers the basic topics of finite element technology, including domain discretization, polynomial interpolation, application of boundary conditions, assembly of global arrays, and solution of the resulting algebraic systems. Finite element formulations for several important field equations are introduced</span><span class="deschide"> using both direct and integral approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on computer simulation and analysis of realistic engineering problems from solid and fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetism. The course uses FEMLAB, a multiphysics MATLAB-based finite element program that possesses a wide array of modeling capabilities and is ideally suited for instruction. Assignments will involve both paper- and computer-based exercises. Computer-based assignments will emphasize the practical aspects of finite element model construction and analysis.</span><br/>
