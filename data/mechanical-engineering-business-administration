<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/entry-level-writing-requirement/">Entry Level Writing</a></p>
<p>All students who enter the University of California as freshmen must demonstrate their command of the English language by fulfilling the Entry Level Writing Requirement. Fulfillment of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all reading and composition courses at UC Berkeley. </p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-history-institutions-requirement/">American History and American Institutions</a></p>
<p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident who graduates from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Campus Requirement</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-cultures-requirement/">American Cultures</a></p>
<p>American Cultures (AC) is the one requirement that all undergraduate students at UC Berkeley need to take and pass in order to graduate. The requirement offers an exciting intellectual environment centered on the study of race, ethnicity, and culture of the United States. AC courses offer students opportunities to be part of research-led, highly accomplished teaching environments, grappling with the complexity of American culture.</p>
<p><strong>M.E.T. Program Requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reading and Composition</strong></p>
<p>Two Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) courses must be taken for a letter grade (C- or better required), and must be completed by no later than the end of the sophomore year (4th semester of enrollment). The first half of R&amp;C, the “A” course, must be completed by the end of the freshman year; the second half of R&amp;C, the “B&quot; course, by no later than the end of the sophomore year or a student's registration will be blocked. View a <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/reading-composition-requirement/">detailed list of courses</a> that fulfill Reading and Composition requirements. </p>
<p><strong>Breadth Requirement</strong></p>
<p>The undergraduate breadth requirement provides Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program. As the foundation of a liberal arts education, breadth courses give students a view into the intellectual life of the University while introducing them to a multitude of perspectives and approaches to research and scholarship. Engaging students in new disciplines and with peers from other majors, the breadth experience strengthens interdisciplinary connections and context that prepare Berkeley graduates to understand and solve the complex issues of their day.</p>
<p>Students in the M.E.T. Program must successfully complete six breadth courses, one in each of the following categories:</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Arts and Literature</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Historical Studies</p>

	<li>No more than two courses from any one department may be used to satisfy the breadth requirement (<a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu/">L&amp;S Discovery courses</a> are exempt).</li>
	<li>Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate exams cannot be used to fulfill the breadth requirement. Some A-Level exams are accepted, but a maximum of two A-Level exams may be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>Two of the breadth courses must be upper-division (courses numbered 100-196).</li>
	<li>Courses numbered 97, 98, 99, or above 196 may not be used to complete any breadth requirement.</li>
	<li>Breadth courses must be a minimum of 3 semester units.</li>

You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework.

The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement.

<h3>Business Administration</h3>
<h5>MISSION</h5>
<p>Guided by the missions of the undergraduate program, and the University's mission of teaching, research, and service, the mission of the Haas School of Business is to develop leaders who redefine how we do business.</p>
<p>The Haas School of Business Undergraduate Program has developed student learning goals for the Business major that provide faculty and students with a shared understanding of the purpose of the major as well as what graduating seniors are expected to know or to be able to do at the end of their course of study as it relates to the school’s mission.</p>
<p>The learning goals are assessed to determine whether students are achieving the outcomes. The assessment results are used to inform curricular design and other program offerings. All steps require input and participation from the business school community, particularly the faculty. The resulting learning goals, which have their origin in the core curriculum, were shaped over several months by faculty and administration and are listed below.</p>
<h5>LEARNING GOALS</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Students will be skilled in critical thinking and decision making, as supported by the appropriate use of analytical and quantitative techniques.</li>
	<li>Students will apply functional area concepts and theories appropriately.</li>
	<li>Students will be effective communicators who can prepare and deliver oral and written presentations using appropriate technologies.</li>
	<li>Students will be sensitive to the ethical requirements of business activities.</li>
	<li>Students will tackle strategic and organizational challenges with innovative solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a visual representation of the relationship between the core curriculum and the expected outcomes, please see the <a href="http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/learninggoals.html" target="_blank">Haas School of Business website</a>.</p>

This course is a general introduction to the fundamental concepts of the mechanics of continuous media. Topics covered include the kinematics of deformation, the concept of stress, and the conservation laws for mass, momentum and energy. This is followed by an introduction to constitutive theory with applications to well-established models for viscous fluids and elastic solids. The concepts are illustrated through the solution of tractable initial-boundary-value</span><span class="deschide"> problems. This course presents foundation-level coverage of theory underlying a number of sub-fields, including Fluid Mechanics, Solid Mechanics and Heat Transfer.</span><br/>

This course explores contemporary research in engineering design and prototyping, as well as related cognitive issues in engineering curricular development, pedagogy, and assessment. One recurring theme throughout the course will be the duality between learning and design: design-based research, design as a pedagogy for integrative learning and the role of cognition and the learning sciences in the practice of engineering design. It has been motivated by several</span><span class="deschide"> reforms: (1) National efforts to better train and educate engineers for the engineering workplace in the 21st Century: to better prepare engineers to face multidisciplinary problems and product design in competitive industries and improve their skills in teamwork and communication.</span><br/>

The goal of this course is to provide a foundation for characterizing and understanding the mechanical behavior of load-bearing tissues. A variety of mechanics topics will be introduced, including anisotropic elasticity and failure, cellular solid theory, biphasic theory, and quasi-linear viscoelasticity (QLV) theory. Building from this theoretical basis, we will explore the constitutive behavior of a wide variety of biological tissues. After</span><span class="deschide"> taking this course, students should have sufficient background to independently study the mechanical behavior of most biological tissues.

The focus of the course is management of innovation processes for sustainable products, from product definition to sustainable manufacturing and financial models. Using a project in which students will be asked to design and develop a product or service focused on sustainability, we will teach processes for collecting customer and user needs data, prioritizing that data, developing a product specification, sketching and building product prototypes</span><span class="deschide">, and interacting with the customer/community during product development. The course is intended as a very hands-on experience in the &quot;green&quot; product development process. The course will be a Management of Technology course offered jointly with the College of Engineering and the Haas School of Business. In addition, it will also receive credit towards the new Certificate on Engineering Sustainability and Environmental Management program. We aim to have half MBA students and half Engineering students (with a few other students, such as from the School of Information) in the class. The instructors will facilitate students to form mixed disciplinary reams for the development of their &quot;green&quot; products.</span><br/>

The course is designed to cover advanced corporate finance issues. Its purpose is two-fold. First, it will help students develop a tool-box, both conceptual and quantitative, to address real-world corporate financial issues that they will likely use immediately in any finance-related career. Second, the course is designed to give the “the big picture,” i.e., sharpen understanding of how corporate financial</span><span class="deschide"> strategy helps increase a firm’s value in a dynamic environment. The course examines qualitative factors that help determine financial strategy, including the costs of financial distress and the value of financial flexibility, as well as quantitative techniques, such as option pricing, that will be helpful in various analyses.</span><br/>

Consumer behavior is the study of how consumers process information, form attitudes and judgments, and make decisions.

Consumer psychology</span><span class="deschide"> is the systematic study of how consumers perceive information, how they encode it in memory, integrate it with other sources of information, retrieve it from memory, and utilize it to make decisions.

This course covers the methods and applications of impact evaluations, which is the science of measuring the causal impact of a program or policy on outcomes of interest. At its essence, impact evaluation is about generating evidence on which policies work, and which don’t. This subject matter should appeal to three main audiences: (1) those in decision-making positions, such as policy makers and business leaders, and</span><span class="deschide"> need to consume the information generated from impact evaluations to make informed evidence-based decisions, (2) project managers, development practitioners and business managers who commission impact evaluations and (3) researchers who actually design and implement impact evaluations.</span><br/>

Energy is one of the main drivers of civilization. Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use. Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed</span><span class="deschide"> world. On the other hand, we must completely overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution. Are these shifts truly within our reach? Can we achieve both simultaneously? If so, how? This Big Ideas course will grapple with these questions using an interdisciplinary systems approach.</span><br/>
