				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Native American Studies Program exists to broaden the understanding of students interested in the history, culture, and contemporary situations of Native Americans in the United States.</p>
<p>The curriculum has been structured to provide courses that deal with both historical and cultural analysis of Native American cultures and contemporary legal and social institutions that affect Native American life. The program not only stresses sound academic preparation in the classroom but also allows students the flexibility to take part in community-oriented education through fieldwork or studies directed towards community situations and problems.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The Native American Studies Program provides a program leading to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree with honors. A student must have senior standing, a 3.5 grade-point average (GPA) overall, and 3.5 GPA in the major. To complete the degree with honors the student will be required to undertake a 6-unit research project (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NATAMST%20H195A" title="NATAMST H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NATAMST H195A');">NATAMST H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NATAMST%20H195B" title="NATAMST H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NATAMST H195B');">NATAMST H195B</a></span>) and will be graded according to standards determined by the faculty advisor as being of honors quality.</p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Native American Studies Program exists to broaden the understanding of students interested in the history, culture, and contemporary situations of Native Americans in the United States.</p>
<p>The curriculum has been structured to provide courses that deal with both historical and cultural analysis of Native American cultures and contemporary legal and social institutions that affect Native American life. The program not only stresses sound academic preparation in the classroom but also allows students the flexibility to take part in community-oriented education through fieldwork or studies directed towards community situations and problems.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The Native American Studies Program provides a program leading to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree with honors. A student must have senior standing, a 3.5 grade-point average (GPA) overall, and 3.5 GPA in the major. To complete the degree with honors the student will be required to undertake a 6-unit research project (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NATAMST%20H195A" title="NATAMST H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NATAMST H195A');">NATAMST H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NATAMST%20H195B" title="NATAMST H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NATAMST H195B');">NATAMST H195B</a></span>) and will be graded according to standards determined by the faculty advisor as being of honors quality.</p>

It explores local differences, attentive to the specificity of</span><span class="deschide"> the national or regional dimension of “the Indian Problem.” And it examines the varied and often complementary tactics that Indigenous people take in their pursuit of political and cultural self-determination.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Native American Studies Program exists to broaden the understanding of students interested in the history, culture, and contemporary situations of Native Americans in the United States.</p>
<p>The curriculum has been structured to provide courses that deal with both historical and cultural analysis of Native American cultures and contemporary legal and social institutions that affect Native American life. The program not only stresses sound academic preparation in the classroom but also allows students the flexibility to take part in community-oriented education through fieldwork or studies directed towards community situations and problems.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The Native American Studies Program provides a program leading to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree with honors. A student must have senior standing, a 3.5 grade-point average (GPA) overall, and 3.5 GPA in the major. To complete the degree with honors the student will be required to undertake a 6-unit research project (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NATAMST%20H195A" title="NATAMST H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NATAMST H195A');">NATAMST H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NATAMST%20H195B" title="NATAMST H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NATAMST H195B');">NATAMST H195B</a></span>) and will be graded according to standards determined by the faculty advisor as being of honors quality.</p>

It explores local differences, attentive to the specificity of</span><span class="deschide"> the national or regional dimension of “the Indian Problem.” And it examines the varied and often complementary tactics that Indigenous people take in their pursuit of political and cultural self-determination.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Native American Studies Program exists to broaden the understanding of students interested in the history, culture, and contemporary situations of Native Americans in the United States.</p>
<p>The curriculum has been structured to provide courses that deal with both historical and cultural analysis of Native American cultures and contemporary legal and social institutions that affect Native American life. The program not only stresses sound academic preparation in the classroom but also allows students the flexibility to take part in community-oriented education through fieldwork or studies directed towards community situations and problems.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The Native American Studies Program provides a program leading to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree with honors. A student must have senior standing, a 3.5 grade-point average (GPA) overall, and 3.5 GPA in the major. To complete the degree with honors the student will be required to undertake a 6-unit research project (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NATAMST%20H195A" title="NATAMST H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NATAMST H195A');">NATAMST H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NATAMST%20H195B" title="NATAMST H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NATAMST H195B');">NATAMST H195B</a></span>) and will be graded according to standards determined by the faculty advisor as being of honors quality.</p>

It explores local differences, attentive to the specificity of</span><span class="deschide"> the national or regional dimension of “the Indian Problem.” And it examines the varied and often complementary tactics that Indigenous people take in their pursuit of political and cultural self-determination.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Native American Studies Program exists to broaden the understanding of students interested in the history, culture, and contemporary situations of Native Americans in the United States.</p>
<p>The curriculum has been structured to provide courses that deal with both historical and cultural analysis of Native American cultures and contemporary legal and social institutions that affect Native American life. The program not only stresses sound academic preparation in the classroom but also allows students the flexibility to take part in community-oriented education through fieldwork or studies directed towards community situations and problems.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The Native American Studies Program provides a program leading to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree with honors. A student must have senior standing, a 3.5 grade-point average (GPA) overall, and 3.5 GPA in the major. To complete the degree with honors the student will be required to undertake a 6-unit research project (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NATAMST%20H195A" title="NATAMST H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NATAMST H195A');">NATAMST H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NATAMST%20H195B" title="NATAMST H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NATAMST H195B');">NATAMST H195B</a></span>) and will be graded according to standards determined by the faculty advisor as being of honors quality.</p>

It explores local differences, attentive to the specificity of</span><span class="deschide"> the national or regional dimension of “the Indian Problem.” And it examines the varied and often complementary tactics that Indigenous people take in their pursuit of political and cultural self-determination.</span><br/>
