				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The College of Chemistry offers a major in Chemical Engineering leading to the Bachelor of Science (BS) degree, through the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. The program equips the student for professional work in development, design, and operation of chemical processes and of process equipment. Students with high scholastic attainment are well prepared to enter graduate programs. The curriculum is accredited by <a href="http://www.abet.org" target="_blank">ABET</a>.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>For information on admission to the major, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/colleges-schools/chemistry/#admissionstext">College of Chemistry Admissions tab</a> in this Guide.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering offers an undergraduate minor in Chemical Engineering. For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the department. Please be sure to consult with your college or school for information on rules regarding overlap of courses between majors and minors.</p>

<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in all courses undertaken at UC Berkeley, including those from UC Summer Sessions, UC Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley in Washington Program, and XB courses from University Extension.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in all courses taken in the college is required in order to advance and continue in the upper division.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in all upper division courses taken at the University is required to satisfy major requirements.</li>
	<li>Students in the College of Chemistry who receive a grade of D+ or lower in a chemical and biomolecular engineering or chemistry course for which a grade of C- or higher is required must repeat the course at UC Berkeley.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding grade requirements in specific courses, please see the notes sections below.</p>
<p>For information regarding residence requirements and unit requirements, please see the College Requirements tab.</p>
<p>Please note, the Academic Guide is updated only once a year. For the most current information on requirements please a look at the College of Chemistry <a href="https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/ugrad/degrees/cheme" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Students must consult with their college/school for information regarding an overlap of courses between their majors and minors.</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The mission of the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To educate people for careers of leadership and innovation in chemical engineering and related fields.</li>
	<li>To expand the base of engineering knowledge through original research and by developing technology to serve the needs of society.</li>
	<li>To benefit the public through service to industry, government, and the engineering profession.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fulfillment of this mission is achieved in part by the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering's accredited undergraduate degree program in chemical engineering. The undergraduate curriculum comprises both a technical curriculum and breadth requirements.</p>
<p>The goals of chemical engineering breadth requirements are to teach the arts of writing clearly and persuasively, to develop the skills to read carefully and evaluate evidence effectively, and to instill an awareness of humanity in historical and social contexts. The Berkeley American Cultures requirement affirms the value of diversity in acquiring knowledge.</p>
<p>The technical curriculum in chemical engineering seeks to provide students with a broad education emphasizing an excellent foundation in scientific and engineering fundamentals.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>1-An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complx engineering problems by applying the principles of engineering, science, and mathematics</p>
<p>2-An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors</p>
<p>3-An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences</p>
<p>4-An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context</p>
<p>5-An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives</p>
<p>6-An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions</p>
<p>7-An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies</p>
