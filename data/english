<h3><span>Additional Information</span></h3>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Internships:</strong> Students wishing to receive academic credit for an <a href="http://career.berkeley.edu/Internships/Internships.stm" target="_blank">internship</a> must coordinate with an English Department faculty member who agrees to sponsor an independent study course (99/199) based on the internship. Students should provide the faculty member with official documentation from their internship employers. Credit is based on completion of critical or creative work on a topic related to the internship. No more than 2 units will be awarded per internship. Please note that students must register for Summer Session, session C, for summer internships.</li>
	<li><strong>Extra-Departmental Course Work: </strong>The options below are provided for enrichment and flexibility, not to replace regular semester courses within the department. Students approved to use two or more courses toward the English major from Education Abroad Programs (EAP) will not be permitted to count additional upper division course work from other UC Berkeley departments. With the exception of two UC Berkeley English Department summer courses, all of the following must be approved by a major advisor and recorded on the student's major record card.</li>
</ol>
<ul style="margin-left:80px">
	<li><strong>Summer Session Courses: </strong>Two 3-unit <a href="http://summer.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Summer Session</a> courses taken at UC Berkeley may be counted toward the major, one of which must be taken through the English department. One of these courses may be taken at another institution with approval. This includes courses taken through Education Abroad Programs. Courses taken through the English department at UC Berkeley during Summer Sessions do not require major advisor approval. For courses taken elsewhere (or outside the major, see below), students must petition for approval by providing documentation, including a course syllabus and a transcript showing the completion of the course. A course taken elsewhere during the summer may only satisfy an elective for the major.</li>
	<li><strong>Courses taken outside the department: </strong>With the approval of a major adviser, students may count up to two upper division courses in departments other than English for the major. Only one such course may be taken during the summer. Students will submit a Petition for Approval of a Course Taken Outside the Department to a major adviser. This form can be found at the front desk in 319 Wheeler Hall. The student's request for course approval will include a course syllabus and a compelling intellectual rationale, one that explains how the student's work for the English major will be enriched through the inclusion of the particular outside course the student wishes to include. There is no preapproved list of courses. For possible courses outside English, consult the listings for anthropology, Celtic studies, comparative literature, ethnic studies, history, linguistics, philosophy, rhetoric, women's studies, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Education Abroad Programs:</strong> A faculty major adviser determines credit toward the major for coursework completed through an <a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/faq/eapqa.html" target="_blank">Education Abroad Program</a> on a case-by-case basis. Students should submit documentation (e.g., course descriptions, syllabi, completed exams, papers, and other written work) to demonstrate that the education abroad course is comparable in coverage, rigor, and substance to a UC Berkeley upper division course. This could include up to two education abroad literature courses in a foreign language. Although there is no official limit on the number of courses transferred from education abroad programs, generally two courses will be counted easily. Closer scrutiny will be given to subsequent course work. Only one summer course taken abroad may be approved for use towards the major. Although the major adviser determines the number of courses approved for use towards the major, the College of Letters &amp; Science makes the final determination of unit credit for any and all courses taken abroad.</li>
	<li><strong><strong>Online and Extension courses: </strong></strong>Only one UC Berkeley Extension or on-line course may be counted toward the major. No UC Berkeley Extension or on-line course may be used to satisfy a core requirement for the major: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGLISH%2045A" title="ENGLISH 45A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGLISH 45A');">ENGLISH 45A</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGLISH%2045B" title="ENGLISH 45B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGLISH 45B');">ENGLISH 45B</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGLISH%2045C" title="ENGLISH 45C" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGLISH 45C');">ENGLISH 45C</a></span> (or their upper division equivalents), Shakespeare, the Pre-1800 course, or the seminar requirement. To count toward the major, UC Berkeley Extension or on-line courses must be comparable in coverage, rigor, and substance to department courses. Students seeking to count a UC Berkeley Extension or online course toward the major should submit course materials and other relevant documentation to an English department major adviser or to the director of undergraduate studies.</li>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The study of literature is not about canonical books or established facts, but about a process of interpretation and analysis, a process that begins in the classroom and develops over a lifetime. Upon completion of a BA degree in English, students should have well-developed writing and research skills as well as the ability to assess and appreciate language and literature in both professional and personal realms.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>

<h3><span>Additional Information</span></h3>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Internships:</strong> Students wishing to receive academic credit for an <a href="http://career.berkeley.edu/Internships/Internships.stm" target="_blank">internship</a> must coordinate with an English Department faculty member who agrees to sponsor an independent study course (99/199) based on the internship. Students should provide the faculty member with official documentation from their internship employers. Credit is based on completion of critical or creative work on a topic related to the internship. No more than 2 units will be awarded per internship. Please note that students must register for Summer Session, session C, for summer internships.</li>
	<li><strong>Extra-Departmental Course Work: </strong>The options below are provided for enrichment and flexibility, not to replace regular semester courses within the department. Students approved to use two or more courses toward the English major from Education Abroad Programs (EAP) will not be permitted to count additional upper division course work from other UC Berkeley departments. With the exception of two UC Berkeley English Department summer courses, all of the following must be approved by a major advisor and recorded on the student's major record card.</li>
</ol>
<ul style="margin-left:80px">
	<li><strong>Summer Session Courses: </strong>Two 3-unit <a href="http://summer.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Summer Session</a> courses taken at UC Berkeley may be counted toward the major, one of which must be taken through the English department. One of these courses may be taken at another institution with approval. This includes courses taken through Education Abroad Programs. Courses taken through the English department at UC Berkeley during Summer Sessions do not require major advisor approval. For courses taken elsewhere (or outside the major, see below), students must petition for approval by providing documentation, including a course syllabus and a transcript showing the completion of the course. A course taken elsewhere during the summer may only satisfy an elective for the major.</li>
	<li><strong>Courses taken outside the department: </strong>With the approval of a major adviser, students may count up to two upper division courses in departments other than English for the major. Only one such course may be taken during the summer. Students will submit a Petition for Approval of a Course Taken Outside the Department to a major adviser. This form can be found at the front desk in 319 Wheeler Hall. The student's request for course approval will include a course syllabus and a compelling intellectual rationale, one that explains how the student's work for the English major will be enriched through the inclusion of the particular outside course the student wishes to include. There is no preapproved list of courses. For possible courses outside English, consult the listings for anthropology, Celtic studies, comparative literature, ethnic studies, history, linguistics, philosophy, rhetoric, women's studies, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Education Abroad Programs:</strong> A faculty major adviser determines credit toward the major for coursework completed through an <a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/faq/eapqa.html" target="_blank">Education Abroad Program</a> on a case-by-case basis. Students should submit documentation (e.g., course descriptions, syllabi, completed exams, papers, and other written work) to demonstrate that the education abroad course is comparable in coverage, rigor, and substance to a UC Berkeley upper division course. This could include up to two education abroad literature courses in a foreign language. Although there is no official limit on the number of courses transferred from education abroad programs, generally two courses will be counted easily. Closer scrutiny will be given to subsequent course work. Only one summer course taken abroad may be approved for use towards the major. Although the major adviser determines the number of courses approved for use towards the major, the College of Letters &amp; Science makes the final determination of unit credit for any and all courses taken abroad.</li>
	<li><strong><strong>Online and Extension courses: </strong></strong>Only one UC Berkeley Extension or on-line course may be counted toward the major. No UC Berkeley Extension or on-line course may be used to satisfy a core requirement for the major: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGLISH%2045A" title="ENGLISH 45A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGLISH 45A');">ENGLISH 45A</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGLISH%2045B" title="ENGLISH 45B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGLISH 45B');">ENGLISH 45B</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGLISH%2045C" title="ENGLISH 45C" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGLISH 45C');">ENGLISH 45C</a></span> (or their upper division equivalents), Shakespeare, the Pre-1800 course, or the seminar requirement. To count toward the major, UC Berkeley Extension or on-line courses must be comparable in coverage, rigor, and substance to department courses. Students seeking to count a UC Berkeley Extension or online course toward the major should submit course materials and other relevant documentation to an English department major adviser or to the director of undergraduate studies.</li>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-921eb48b-58a4-40de-fda9-b38a24dab9fd">For students considering graduating in less than four years, it's important to acknowledge the reasons to undertake such a plan of study. While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation.

	<li>Become conversant with key literary terms and theories.</li>
	<li>Develop an understanding of literature in interdisciplinary and multicultural contexts.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to give a close reading or explication of a text.</li>
	<li>Develop the ability to interpret and analyze literary texts and to articulate that in both writing and speaking.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate an understanding of the philosophical, cultural, social, and historical influences on the creation of literary art.</li>
	<li>Formulate a well-organized, well-supported argument.</li>
	<li>Develop research skills in the library and online.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to write clear critical essays, based on close reading of primary texts and secondary sources.</li>

<h3><span>Additional Information</span></h3>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Internships:</strong> Students wishing to receive academic credit for an <a href="http://career.berkeley.edu/Internships/Internships.stm" target="_blank">internship</a> must coordinate with an English Department faculty member who agrees to sponsor an independent study course (99/199) based on the internship. Students should provide the faculty member with official documentation from their internship employers. Credit is based on completion of critical or creative work on a topic related to the internship. No more than 2 units will be awarded per internship. Please note that students must register for Summer Session, session C, for summer internships.</li>
	<li><strong>Extra-Departmental Course Work: </strong>The options below are provided for enrichment and flexibility, not to replace regular semester courses within the department. Students approved to use two or more courses toward the English major from Education Abroad Programs (EAP) will not be permitted to count additional upper division course work from other UC Berkeley departments. With the exception of two UC Berkeley English Department summer courses, all of the following must be approved by a major advisor and recorded on the student's major record card.</li>
</ol>
<ul style="margin-left:80px">
	<li><strong>Summer Session Courses: </strong>Two 3-unit <a href="http://summer.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Summer Session</a> courses taken at UC Berkeley may be counted toward the major, one of which must be taken through the English department. One of these courses may be taken at another institution with approval. This includes courses taken through Education Abroad Programs. Courses taken through the English department at UC Berkeley during Summer Sessions do not require major advisor approval. For courses taken elsewhere (or outside the major, see below), students must petition for approval by providing documentation, including a course syllabus and a transcript showing the completion of the course. A course taken elsewhere during the summer may only satisfy an elective for the major.</li>
	<li><strong>Courses taken outside the department: </strong>With the approval of a major adviser, students may count up to two upper division courses in departments other than English for the major. Only one such course may be taken during the summer. Students will submit a Petition for Approval of a Course Taken Outside the Department to a major adviser. This form can be found at the front desk in 319 Wheeler Hall. The student's request for course approval will include a course syllabus and a compelling intellectual rationale, one that explains how the student's work for the English major will be enriched through the inclusion of the particular outside course the student wishes to include. There is no preapproved list of courses. For possible courses outside English, consult the listings for anthropology, Celtic studies, comparative literature, ethnic studies, history, linguistics, philosophy, rhetoric, women's studies, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Education Abroad Programs:</strong> A faculty major adviser determines credit toward the major for coursework completed through an <a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/faq/eapqa.html" target="_blank">Education Abroad Program</a> on a case-by-case basis. Students should submit documentation (e.g., course descriptions, syllabi, completed exams, papers, and other written work) to demonstrate that the education abroad course is comparable in coverage, rigor, and substance to a UC Berkeley upper division course. This could include up to two education abroad literature courses in a foreign language. Although there is no official limit on the number of courses transferred from education abroad programs, generally two courses will be counted easily. Closer scrutiny will be given to subsequent course work. Only one summer course taken abroad may be approved for use towards the major. Although the major adviser determines the number of courses approved for use towards the major, the College of Letters &amp; Science makes the final determination of unit credit for any and all courses taken abroad.</li>
	<li><strong><strong>Online and Extension courses: </strong></strong>Only one UC Berkeley Extension or on-line course may be counted toward the major. No UC Berkeley Extension or on-line course may be used to satisfy a core requirement for the major: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGLISH%2045A" title="ENGLISH 45A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGLISH 45A');">ENGLISH 45A</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGLISH%2045B" title="ENGLISH 45B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGLISH 45B');">ENGLISH 45B</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGLISH%2045C" title="ENGLISH 45C" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGLISH 45C');">ENGLISH 45C</a></span> (or their upper division equivalents), Shakespeare, the Pre-1800 course, or the seminar requirement. To count toward the major, UC Berkeley Extension or on-line courses must be comparable in coverage, rigor, and substance to department courses. Students seeking to count a UC Berkeley Extension or online course toward the major should submit course materials and other relevant documentation to an English department major adviser or to the director of undergraduate studies.</li>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>

While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation.

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The study of literature is not about canonical books or established facts, but about a process of interpretation and analysis, a process that begins in the classroom and develops over a lifetime. Upon completion of a BA degree in English, students should have well-developed writing and research skills as well as the ability to assess and appreciate language and literature in both professional and personal realms.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Identify historical periods of literature in English ( US, Britain, and Anglophone).</li>
	<li>Recognize and understand a variety of genres and modes of writing (the novel, poetic forms, short fiction, autobiography, etc.).</li>
	<li>Become conversant with key literary terms and theories.</li>
	<li>Develop an understanding of literature in interdisciplinary and multicultural contexts.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to give a close reading or explication of a text.</li>
	<li>Develop the ability to interpret and analyze literary texts and to articulate that in both writing and speaking.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate an understanding of the philosophical, cultural, social, and historical influences on the creation of literary art.</li>
	<li>Formulate a well-organized, well-supported argument.</li>
	<li>Develop research skills in the library and online.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to write clear critical essays, based on close reading of primary texts and secondary sources.</li>
	<li>Observe ethical and precise citation practices.</li>
	<li>For some, write well in creative modes: fiction, non-fiction, poetry.</li>

<h3><span>Additional Information</span></h3>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Internships:</strong> Students wishing to receive academic credit for an <a href="http://career.berkeley.edu/Internships/Internships.stm" target="_blank">internship</a> must coordinate with an English Department faculty member who agrees to sponsor an independent study course (99/199) based on the internship. Students should provide the faculty member with official documentation from their internship employers. Credit is based on completion of critical or creative work on a topic related to the internship. No more than 2 units will be awarded per internship. Please note that students must register for Summer Session, session C, for summer internships.</li>
	<li><strong>Extra-Departmental Course Work: </strong>The options below are provided for enrichment and flexibility, not to replace regular semester courses within the department. Students approved to use two or more courses toward the English major from Education Abroad Programs (EAP) will not be permitted to count additional upper division course work from other UC Berkeley departments. With the exception of two UC Berkeley English Department summer courses, all of the following must be approved by a major advisor and recorded on the student's major record card.</li>
</ol>
<ul style="margin-left:80px">
	<li><strong>Summer Session Courses: </strong>Two 3-unit <a href="http://summer.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Summer Session</a> courses taken at UC Berkeley may be counted toward the major, one of which must be taken through the English department. One of these courses may be taken at another institution with approval. This includes courses taken through Education Abroad Programs. Courses taken through the English department at UC Berkeley during Summer Sessions do not require major advisor approval. For courses taken elsewhere (or outside the major, see below), students must petition for approval by providing documentation, including a course syllabus and a transcript showing the completion of the course. A course taken elsewhere during the summer may only satisfy an elective for the major.</li>
	<li><strong>Courses taken outside the department: </strong>With the approval of a major adviser, students may count up to two upper division courses in departments other than English for the major. Only one such course may be taken during the summer. Students will submit a Petition for Approval of a Course Taken Outside the Department to a major adviser. This form can be found at the front desk in 319 Wheeler Hall. The student's request for course approval will include a course syllabus and a compelling intellectual rationale, one that explains how the student's work for the English major will be enriched through the inclusion of the particular outside course the student wishes to include. There is no preapproved list of courses. For possible courses outside English, consult the listings for anthropology, Celtic studies, comparative literature, ethnic studies, history, linguistics, philosophy, rhetoric, women's studies, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Education Abroad Programs:</strong> A faculty major adviser determines credit toward the major for coursework completed through an <a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/faq/eapqa.html" target="_blank">Education Abroad Program</a> on a case-by-case basis. Students should submit documentation (e.g., course descriptions, syllabi, completed exams, papers, and other written work) to demonstrate that the education abroad course is comparable in coverage, rigor, and substance to a UC Berkeley upper division course. This could include up to two education abroad literature courses in a foreign language. Although there is no official limit on the number of courses transferred from education abroad programs, generally two courses will be counted easily. Closer scrutiny will be given to subsequent course work. Only one summer course taken abroad may be approved for use towards the major. Although the major adviser determines the number of courses approved for use towards the major, the College of Letters &amp; Science makes the final determination of unit credit for any and all courses taken abroad.</li>
	<li><strong><strong>Online and Extension courses: </strong></strong>Only one UC Berkeley Extension or on-line course may be counted toward the major. No UC Berkeley Extension or on-line course may be used to satisfy a core requirement for the major: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGLISH%2045A" title="ENGLISH 45A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGLISH 45A');">ENGLISH 45A</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGLISH%2045B" title="ENGLISH 45B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGLISH 45B');">ENGLISH 45B</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGLISH%2045C" title="ENGLISH 45C" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGLISH 45C');">ENGLISH 45C</a></span> (or their upper division equivalents), Shakespeare, the Pre-1800 course, or the seminar requirement. To count toward the major, UC Berkeley Extension or on-line courses must be comparable in coverage, rigor, and substance to department courses. Students seeking to count a UC Berkeley Extension or online course toward the major should submit course materials and other relevant documentation to an English department major adviser or to the director of undergraduate studies.</li>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>

<h3>Additional Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>With the approval of a minor advisor, students may take up to two courses outside the Berkeley English department (e.g. in other departments, other academic institutions, and education abroad programs). Students will submit a Petition for Approval of a Course Taken Outside the Department to a minor adviser.  This form can be found at the front desk in 319 Wheeler Hall. The student’s request for course approval will include a course syllabus and a compelling intellectual rationale, one that explains how the student’s work for the English minor will be enriched through the inclusion of the particular outside course the student wishes to take. There is no pre-approved list of courses.</li>
	<li>Only one Summer Session course taken at UC Berkeley may be counted toward the minor.</li>
	<li>Creative Writing courses in the English department do not count toward the minor.</li>

<ol>
	<li>Identify historical periods of literature in English ( US, Britain, and Anglophone).</li>
	<li>Recognize and understand a variety of genres and modes of writing (the novel, poetic forms, short fiction, autobiography, etc.).</li>
	<li>Become conversant with key literary terms and theories.</li>
	<li>Develop an understanding of literature in interdisciplinary and multicultural contexts.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to give a close reading or explication of a text.</li>
	<li>Develop the ability to interpret and analyze literary texts and to articulate that in both writing and speaking.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate an understanding of the philosophical, cultural, social, and historical influences on the creation of literary art.</li>
	<li>Formulate a well-organized, well-supported argument.</li>
	<li>Develop research skills in the library and online.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to write clear critical essays, based on close reading of primary texts and secondary sources.</li>
	<li>Observe ethical and precise citation practices.</li>
	<li>For some, write well in creative modes: fiction, non-fiction, poetry.</li>

<h3><span>Additional Information</span></h3>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Internships:</strong> Students wishing to receive academic credit for an <a href="http://career.berkeley.edu/Internships/Internships.stm" target="_blank">internship</a> must coordinate with an English Department faculty member who agrees to sponsor an independent study course (99/199) based on the internship. Students should provide the faculty member with official documentation from their internship employers. Credit is based on completion of critical or creative work on a topic related to the internship. No more than 2 units will be awarded per internship. Please note that students must register for Summer Session, session C, for summer internships.</li>
	<li><strong>Extra-Departmental Course Work: </strong>The options below are provided for enrichment and flexibility, not to replace regular semester courses within the department. Students approved to use two or more courses toward the English major from Education Abroad Programs (EAP) will not be permitted to count additional upper division course work from other UC Berkeley departments. With the exception of two UC Berkeley English Department summer courses, all of the following must be approved by a major advisor and recorded on the student's major record card.</li>
</ol>
<ul style="margin-left:80px">
	<li><strong>Summer Session Courses: </strong>Two 3-unit <a href="http://summer.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Summer Session</a> courses taken at UC Berkeley may be counted toward the major, one of which must be taken through the English department. One of these courses may be taken at another institution with approval. This includes courses taken through Education Abroad Programs. Courses taken through the English department at UC Berkeley during Summer Sessions do not require major advisor approval. For courses taken elsewhere (or outside the major, see below), students must petition for approval by providing documentation, including a course syllabus and a transcript showing the completion of the course. A course taken elsewhere during the summer may only satisfy an elective for the major.</li>
	<li><strong>Courses taken outside the department: </strong>With the approval of a major adviser, students may count up to two upper division courses in departments other than English for the major. Only one such course may be taken during the summer. Students will submit a Petition for Approval of a Course Taken Outside the Department to a major adviser. This form can be found at the front desk in 319 Wheeler Hall. The student's request for course approval will include a course syllabus and a compelling intellectual rationale, one that explains how the student's work for the English major will be enriched through the inclusion of the particular outside course the student wishes to include. There is no preapproved list of courses. For possible courses outside English, consult the listings for anthropology, Celtic studies, comparative literature, ethnic studies, history, linguistics, philosophy, rhetoric, women's studies, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Education Abroad Programs:</strong> A faculty major adviser determines credit toward the major for coursework completed through an <a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/faq/eapqa.html" target="_blank">Education Abroad Program</a> on a case-by-case basis. Students should submit documentation (e.g., course descriptions, syllabi, completed exams, papers, and other written work) to demonstrate that the education abroad course is comparable in coverage, rigor, and substance to a UC Berkeley upper division course. This could include up to two education abroad literature courses in a foreign language. Although there is no official limit on the number of courses transferred from education abroad programs, generally two courses will be counted easily. Closer scrutiny will be given to subsequent course work. Only one summer course taken abroad may be approved for use towards the major. Although the major adviser determines the number of courses approved for use towards the major, the College of Letters &amp; Science makes the final determination of unit credit for any and all courses taken abroad.</li>
	<li><strong><strong>Online and Extension courses: </strong></strong>Only one UC Berkeley Extension or on-line course may be counted toward the major. No UC Berkeley Extension or on-line course may be used to satisfy a core requirement for the major: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGLISH%2045A" title="ENGLISH 45A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGLISH 45A');">ENGLISH 45A</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGLISH%2045B" title="ENGLISH 45B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGLISH 45B');">ENGLISH 45B</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGLISH%2045C" title="ENGLISH 45C" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGLISH 45C');">ENGLISH 45C</a></span> (or their upper division equivalents), Shakespeare, the Pre-1800 course, or the seminar requirement. To count toward the major, UC Berkeley Extension or on-line courses must be comparable in coverage, rigor, and substance to department courses. Students seeking to count a UC Berkeley Extension or online course toward the major should submit course materials and other relevant documentation to an English department major adviser or to the director of undergraduate studies.</li>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>

While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation.

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The study of literature is not about canonical books or established facts, but about a process of interpretation and analysis, a process that begins in the classroom and develops over a lifetime. Upon completion of a BA degree in English, students should have well-developed writing and research skills as well as the ability to assess and appreciate language and literature in both professional and personal realms.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Identify historical periods of literature in English ( US, Britain, and Anglophone).</li>
	<li>Recognize and understand a variety of genres and modes of writing (the novel, poetic forms, short fiction, autobiography, etc.).</li>
	<li>Become conversant with key literary terms and theories.</li>
	<li>Develop an understanding of literature in interdisciplinary and multicultural contexts.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to give a close reading or explication of a text.</li>
	<li>Develop the ability to interpret and analyze literary texts and to articulate that in both writing and speaking.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate an understanding of the philosophical, cultural, social, and historical influences on the creation of literary art.</li>
	<li>Formulate a well-organized, well-supported argument.</li>
	<li>Develop research skills in the library and online.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to write clear critical essays, based on close reading of primary texts and secondary sources.</li>
	<li>Observe ethical and precise citation practices.</li>
	<li>For some, write well in creative modes: fiction, non-fiction, poetry.</li>
