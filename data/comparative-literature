				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Literature is a cultural site where the present is negotiated, the past excavated, and the future envisioned. In a globalized world where the circulation of blogs, legal documents, political manifestos, manuscripts, online journals, and images constantly shapes and reshapes human experience, understanding texts is utterly essential.</p>
<p>Majoring in comparative literature provides students with tools for analyzing texts, writing, editing, translating, and thinking across disciplinary and national boundaries. Our majors engage a variety of literary traditions and historical periods, from Latin American concrete poetry to Yiddish experimental fiction. The department offers rigorous training in the following areas of strength of our internationally recognized faculty: French, German, Italian, Hebrew studies, classics, critical theory, East Asian literatures and arts, performance studies, film and media, poetry and poetics, gender and sexuality, postcolonial theory, English and American literatures, early modern and Renaissance studies and Slavic literatures and cultures.</p>
<p>All members of the department are deeply invested in the academic development of our students and value you as an integral part of the Comparative Literature community at UC Berkeley. The department aims to develop your creative and intellectual interests and talents. As a major, you receive the opportunity to pursue rigorous research in a variety of literatures according to your interests, engage in team-based projects, participate in discussions about political, aesthetic, and social issues, and develop a nuanced cross-cultural understanding of historical and social processes. All of our students have close contact with cutting edge scholars in their fields in a small classroom setting, with extensive individualized work. Our undergraduate majors publish and edit their own journal of comparative literature (CLUJ) and run an annual research conference. Most majors also choose to spend time in study abroad to deepen their cultural and linguistic knowledge.</p>
<p>Our students benefit from training in comparative literature and go on to work in a variety of professions, including journalism, media, publishing, translation, theater, and politics as well as in many roles in the legal, corporate, social, medical, and arts sectors. Additionally, we prepare our students to enter top graduate programs in the US and abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;That is part of the beauty of all literature. You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you are not lonely and isolated from anyone. You belong.&quot;</p>
<p>—F. Scott Fitzgerald</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>If you are thinking of majoring in Comparative Literature, come meet with the major adviser at your earliest opportunity. You will probably discover that the requirements are flexible enough to suit you, and may find it to your advantage to ask the department's adviser to suggest relevant freshman and sophomore courses.</p>
<p>Majors must see the major adviser each semester to plan a program for the coming year in order to pre-enroll via the CalCentral enrollment system. The Major Requirements tab to the right outlines the basic requirements. Keep in mind that most of these requirements will be adjusted according to the language areas in which you plan to work and your own long range plans.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students who have attained junior standing may be admitted to the honors program if they:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have accumulated at least an overall 3.55 grade point average (GPA) and at least a 3.65 GPA in the major.</li>
	<li>Have completed at least 8 upper division units in literature, including <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=COM%20LIT%20100" title="COM LIT 100">COM LIT 100</a> or the equivalent.</li>
	<li>Are prepared to do upper division work in one vernacular foreign literature or one classical literature.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the requirements for the regular program outlined above, candidates for the BA with honors in Comparative Literature must demonstrate, through either examination or coursework, a sense of the historical development of their principal literature, and earn a grade of B or higher for an honors thesis in <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=COM%20LIT%20H195" title="COM LIT H195">COM LIT H195</a>. Students interested in the honors program are urged to consult an adviser in the Department of Comparative Literature at their earliest opportunity.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Comparative Literature has a new minor program, open to all UC Berkeley students regardless of college.  The minor comprises of 5 courses; the 3 &quot;core&quot; classes required for the major (COM LIT 100, CL151-165, and COM LIT 190) along with two courses from the &quot;secondary&quot; literature.  For more information, please review the department site at complit.berkeley.edu or contact the Comparative Literature major adviser at <a href="mailto:complituga@berkeley.edu">complituga@berkeley.edu</a>.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://complit.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Study Abroad</h3>
<p>Many Comparative Literature students study abroad. The department actively encourages this experience. International study can be enlightening and fulfilling, both personally and academically. Although study abroad requires some planning ahead, the benefits are well worth the effort for most students.</p>
<p><a href="http://studyabroad.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Study Abroad (BSA)</a> is a University of California, system-wide program. Located in 160 Stephens Hall, BSA administers education abroad for Berkeley students. To begin planning an overseas program, or for more information, contact an adviser in the BSA Office or phone 510-642-1356.</p>
<p>The Office of Undergraduate Admissions offers assistance to students who want to participate in non-BSA programs. The office at 110 Sproul Hall provides advising during scheduled drop-in hours.</p>
<p>The Department of Comparative Literature expects its students to make normal degree progress and will review standing in the major before approving a semester or year abroad. Advanced consultation with the department adviser is highly recommended.</p>
<h3>Comparative Literature Undergraduate Journal (CLUJ)</h3>
<p>Students have the opportunity to run their own departmentally-supported journal, including writing, editing, and publishing. For more information, contact the Comparative Literature undergraduate academic adviser or look for the corresponding DeCal course at DeCal course listings.</p>
<h3>Comparative Literature Research Symposium</h3>
<p>Another opportunity is to participate in the annual Research Symposium, where scholars from around the world discuss their research. Typically the Symposium is held in early April. For more information, contact the Comparative Literature undergraduate academic adviser. </p>

Students are not required to be declared majors in order to participate. Course may be repeated for credit.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Literature is a cultural site where the present is negotiated, the past excavated, and the future envisioned. In a globalized world where the circulation of blogs, legal documents, political manifestos, manuscripts, online journals, and images constantly shapes and reshapes human experience, understanding texts is utterly essential.</p>
<p>Majoring in comparative literature provides students with tools for analyzing texts, writing, editing, translating, and thinking across disciplinary and national boundaries. Our majors engage a variety of literary traditions and historical periods, from Latin American concrete poetry to Yiddish experimental fiction. The department offers rigorous training in the following areas of strength of our internationally recognized faculty: French, German, Italian, Hebrew studies, classics, critical theory, East Asian literatures and arts, performance studies, film and media, poetry and poetics, gender and sexuality, postcolonial theory, English and American literatures, early modern and Renaissance studies and Slavic literatures and cultures.</p>
<p>All members of the department are deeply invested in the academic development of our students and value you as an integral part of the Comparative Literature community at UC Berkeley. The department aims to develop your creative and intellectual interests and talents. As a major, you receive the opportunity to pursue rigorous research in a variety of literatures according to your interests, engage in team-based projects, participate in discussions about political, aesthetic, and social issues, and develop a nuanced cross-cultural understanding of historical and social processes. All of our students have close contact with cutting edge scholars in their fields in a small classroom setting, with extensive individualized work. Our undergraduate majors publish and edit their own journal of comparative literature (CLUJ) and run an annual research conference. Most majors also choose to spend time in study abroad to deepen their cultural and linguistic knowledge.</p>
<p>Our students benefit from training in comparative literature and go on to work in a variety of professions, including journalism, media, publishing, translation, theater, and politics as well as in many roles in the legal, corporate, social, medical, and arts sectors. Additionally, we prepare our students to enter top graduate programs in the US and abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;That is part of the beauty of all literature. You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you are not lonely and isolated from anyone. You belong.&quot;</p>
<p>—F. Scott Fitzgerald</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>If you are thinking of majoring in Comparative Literature, come meet with the major adviser at your earliest opportunity. You will probably discover that the requirements are flexible enough to suit you, and may find it to your advantage to ask the department's adviser to suggest relevant freshman and sophomore courses.</p>
<p>Majors must see the major adviser each semester to plan a program for the coming year in order to pre-enroll via the CalCentral enrollment system. The Major Requirements tab to the right outlines the basic requirements. Keep in mind that most of these requirements will be adjusted according to the language areas in which you plan to work and your own long range plans.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students who have attained junior standing may be admitted to the honors program if they:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have accumulated at least an overall 3.55 grade point average (GPA) and at least a 3.65 GPA in the major.</li>
	<li>Have completed at least 8 upper division units in literature, including <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=COM%20LIT%20100" title="COM LIT 100">COM LIT 100</a> or the equivalent.</li>
	<li>Are prepared to do upper division work in one vernacular foreign literature or one classical literature.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the requirements for the regular program outlined above, candidates for the BA with honors in Comparative Literature must demonstrate, through either examination or coursework, a sense of the historical development of their principal literature, and earn a grade of B or higher for an honors thesis in <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=COM%20LIT%20H195" title="COM LIT H195">COM LIT H195</a>. Students interested in the honors program are urged to consult an adviser in the Department of Comparative Literature at their earliest opportunity.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Comparative Literature has a new minor program, open to all UC Berkeley students regardless of college.  The minor comprises of 5 courses; the 3 &quot;core&quot; classes required for the major (COM LIT 100, CL151-165, and COM LIT 190) along with two courses from the &quot;secondary&quot; literature.  For more information, please review the department site at complit.berkeley.edu or contact the Comparative Literature major adviser at <a href="mailto:complituga@berkeley.edu">complituga@berkeley.edu</a>.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://complit.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Study Abroad</h3>
<p>Many Comparative Literature students study abroad. The department actively encourages this experience. International study can be enlightening and fulfilling, both personally and academically. Although study abroad requires some planning ahead, the benefits are well worth the effort for most students.</p>
<p><a href="http://studyabroad.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Study Abroad (BSA)</a> is a University of California, system-wide program. Located in 160 Stephens Hall, BSA administers education abroad for Berkeley students. To begin planning an overseas program, or for more information, contact an adviser in the BSA Office or phone 510-642-1356.</p>
<p>The Office of Undergraduate Admissions offers assistance to students who want to participate in non-BSA programs. The office at 110 Sproul Hall provides advising during scheduled drop-in hours.</p>
<p>The Department of Comparative Literature expects its students to make normal degree progress and will review standing in the major before approving a semester or year abroad. Advanced consultation with the department adviser is highly recommended.</p>
<h3>Comparative Literature Undergraduate Journal (CLUJ)</h3>
<p>Students have the opportunity to run their own departmentally-supported journal, including writing, editing, and publishing. For more information, contact the Comparative Literature undergraduate academic adviser or look for the corresponding DeCal course at DeCal course listings.</p>
<h3>Comparative Literature Research Symposium</h3>
<p>Another opportunity is to participate in the annual Research Symposium, where scholars from around the world discuss their research. Typically the Symposium is held in early April. For more information, contact the Comparative Literature undergraduate academic adviser. </p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Literature is a cultural site where the present is negotiated, the past excavated, and the future envisioned. In a globalized world where the circulation of blogs, legal documents, political manifestos, manuscripts, online journals, and images constantly shapes and reshapes human experience, understanding texts is utterly essential.</p>
<p>Majoring in comparative literature provides students with tools for analyzing texts, writing, editing, translating, and thinking across disciplinary and national boundaries. Our majors engage a variety of literary traditions and historical periods, from Latin American concrete poetry to Yiddish experimental fiction. The department offers rigorous training in the following areas of strength of our internationally recognized faculty: French, German, Italian, Hebrew studies, classics, critical theory, East Asian literatures and arts, performance studies, film and media, poetry and poetics, gender and sexuality, postcolonial theory, English and American literatures, early modern and Renaissance studies and Slavic literatures and cultures.</p>
<p>All members of the department are deeply invested in the academic development of our students and value you as an integral part of the Comparative Literature community at UC Berkeley. The department aims to develop your creative and intellectual interests and talents. As a major, you receive the opportunity to pursue rigorous research in a variety of literatures according to your interests, engage in team-based projects, participate in discussions about political, aesthetic, and social issues, and develop a nuanced cross-cultural understanding of historical and social processes. All of our students have close contact with cutting edge scholars in their fields in a small classroom setting, with extensive individualized work. Our undergraduate majors publish and edit their own journal of comparative literature (CLUJ) and run an annual research conference. Most majors also choose to spend time in study abroad to deepen their cultural and linguistic knowledge.</p>
<p>Our students benefit from training in comparative literature and go on to work in a variety of professions, including journalism, media, publishing, translation, theater, and politics as well as in many roles in the legal, corporate, social, medical, and arts sectors. Additionally, we prepare our students to enter top graduate programs in the US and abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;That is part of the beauty of all literature. You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you are not lonely and isolated from anyone. You belong.&quot;</p>
<p>—F. Scott Fitzgerald</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>If you are thinking of majoring in Comparative Literature, come meet with the major adviser at your earliest opportunity. You will probably discover that the requirements are flexible enough to suit you, and may find it to your advantage to ask the department's adviser to suggest relevant freshman and sophomore courses.</p>
<p>Majors must see the major adviser each semester to plan a program for the coming year in order to pre-enroll via the CalCentral enrollment system. The Major Requirements tab to the right outlines the basic requirements. Keep in mind that most of these requirements will be adjusted according to the language areas in which you plan to work and your own long range plans.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students who have attained junior standing may be admitted to the honors program if they:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have accumulated at least an overall 3.55 grade point average (GPA) and at least a 3.65 GPA in the major.</li>
	<li>Have completed at least 8 upper division units in literature, including <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=COM%20LIT%20100" title="COM LIT 100">COM LIT 100</a> or the equivalent.</li>
	<li>Are prepared to do upper division work in one vernacular foreign literature or one classical literature.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the requirements for the regular program outlined above, candidates for the BA with honors in Comparative Literature must demonstrate, through either examination or coursework, a sense of the historical development of their principal literature, and earn a grade of B or higher for an honors thesis in <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=COM%20LIT%20H195" title="COM LIT H195">COM LIT H195</a>. Students interested in the honors program are urged to consult an adviser in the Department of Comparative Literature at their earliest opportunity.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Comparative Literature has a new minor program, open to all UC Berkeley students regardless of college.  The minor comprises of 5 courses; the 3 &quot;core&quot; classes required for the major (COM LIT 100, CL151-165, and COM LIT 190) along with two courses from the &quot;secondary&quot; literature.  For more information, please review the department site at complit.berkeley.edu or contact the Comparative Literature major adviser at <a href="mailto:complituga@berkeley.edu">complituga@berkeley.edu</a>.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://complit.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Study Abroad</h3>
<p>Many Comparative Literature students study abroad. The department actively encourages this experience. International study can be enlightening and fulfilling, both personally and academically. Although study abroad requires some planning ahead, the benefits are well worth the effort for most students.</p>
<p><a href="http://studyabroad.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Study Abroad (BSA)</a> is a University of California, system-wide program. Located in 160 Stephens Hall, BSA administers education abroad for Berkeley students. To begin planning an overseas program, or for more information, contact an adviser in the BSA Office or phone 510-642-1356.</p>
<p>The Office of Undergraduate Admissions offers assistance to students who want to participate in non-BSA programs. The office at 110 Sproul Hall provides advising during scheduled drop-in hours.</p>
<p>The Department of Comparative Literature expects its students to make normal degree progress and will review standing in the major before approving a semester or year abroad. Advanced consultation with the department adviser is highly recommended.</p>
<h3>Comparative Literature Undergraduate Journal (CLUJ)</h3>
<p>Students have the opportunity to run their own departmentally-supported journal, including writing, editing, and publishing. For more information, contact the Comparative Literature undergraduate academic adviser or look for the corresponding DeCal course at DeCal course listings.</p>
<h3>Comparative Literature Research Symposium</h3>
<p>Another opportunity is to participate in the annual Research Symposium, where scholars from around the world discuss their research. Typically the Symposium is held in early April. For more information, contact the Comparative Literature undergraduate academic adviser. </p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Literature is a cultural site where the present is negotiated, the past excavated, and the future envisioned. In a globalized world where the circulation of blogs, legal documents, political manifestos, manuscripts, online journals, and images constantly shapes and reshapes human experience, understanding texts is utterly essential.</p>
<p>Majoring in comparative literature provides students with tools for analyzing texts, writing, editing, translating, and thinking across disciplinary and national boundaries. Our majors engage a variety of literary traditions and historical periods, from Latin American concrete poetry to Yiddish experimental fiction. The department offers rigorous training in the following areas of strength of our internationally recognized faculty: French, German, Italian, Hebrew studies, classics, critical theory, East Asian literatures and arts, performance studies, film and media, poetry and poetics, gender and sexuality, postcolonial theory, English and American literatures, early modern and Renaissance studies and Slavic literatures and cultures.</p>
<p>All members of the department are deeply invested in the academic development of our students and value you as an integral part of the Comparative Literature community at UC Berkeley. The department aims to develop your creative and intellectual interests and talents. As a major, you receive the opportunity to pursue rigorous research in a variety of literatures according to your interests, engage in team-based projects, participate in discussions about political, aesthetic, and social issues, and develop a nuanced cross-cultural understanding of historical and social processes. All of our students have close contact with cutting edge scholars in their fields in a small classroom setting, with extensive individualized work. Our undergraduate majors publish and edit their own journal of comparative literature (CLUJ) and run an annual research conference. Most majors also choose to spend time in study abroad to deepen their cultural and linguistic knowledge.</p>
<p>Our students benefit from training in comparative literature and go on to work in a variety of professions, including journalism, media, publishing, translation, theater, and politics as well as in many roles in the legal, corporate, social, medical, and arts sectors. Additionally, we prepare our students to enter top graduate programs in the US and abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;That is part of the beauty of all literature. You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you are not lonely and isolated from anyone. You belong.&quot;</p>
<p>—F. Scott Fitzgerald</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>If you are thinking of majoring in Comparative Literature, come meet with the major adviser at your earliest opportunity. You will probably discover that the requirements are flexible enough to suit you, and may find it to your advantage to ask the department's adviser to suggest relevant freshman and sophomore courses.</p>
<p>Majors must see the major adviser each semester to plan a program for the coming year in order to pre-enroll via the CalCentral enrollment system. The Major Requirements tab to the right outlines the basic requirements. Keep in mind that most of these requirements will be adjusted according to the language areas in which you plan to work and your own long range plans.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students who have attained junior standing may be admitted to the honors program if they:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have accumulated at least an overall 3.55 grade point average (GPA) and at least a 3.65 GPA in the major.</li>
	<li>Have completed at least 8 upper division units in literature, including <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=COM%20LIT%20100" title="COM LIT 100">COM LIT 100</a> or the equivalent.</li>
	<li>Are prepared to do upper division work in one vernacular foreign literature or one classical literature.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the requirements for the regular program outlined above, candidates for the BA with honors in Comparative Literature must demonstrate, through either examination or coursework, a sense of the historical development of their principal literature, and earn a grade of B or higher for an honors thesis in <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=COM%20LIT%20H195" title="COM LIT H195">COM LIT H195</a>. Students interested in the honors program are urged to consult an adviser in the Department of Comparative Literature at their earliest opportunity.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Comparative Literature has a new minor program, open to all UC Berkeley students regardless of college.  The minor comprises of 5 courses; the 3 &quot;core&quot; classes required for the major (COM LIT 100, CL151-165, and COM LIT 190) along with two courses from the &quot;secondary&quot; literature.  For more information, please review the department site at complit.berkeley.edu or contact the Comparative Literature major adviser at <a href="mailto:complituga@berkeley.edu">complituga@berkeley.edu</a>.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://complit.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Study Abroad</h3>
<p>Many Comparative Literature students study abroad. The department actively encourages this experience. International study can be enlightening and fulfilling, both personally and academically. Although study abroad requires some planning ahead, the benefits are well worth the effort for most students.</p>
<p><a href="http://studyabroad.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Study Abroad (BSA)</a> is a University of California, system-wide program. Located in 160 Stephens Hall, BSA administers education abroad for Berkeley students. To begin planning an overseas program, or for more information, contact an adviser in the BSA Office or phone 510-642-1356.</p>
<p>The Office of Undergraduate Admissions offers assistance to students who want to participate in non-BSA programs. The office at 110 Sproul Hall provides advising during scheduled drop-in hours.</p>
<p>The Department of Comparative Literature expects its students to make normal degree progress and will review standing in the major before approving a semester or year abroad. Advanced consultation with the department adviser is highly recommended.</p>
<h3>Comparative Literature Undergraduate Journal (CLUJ)</h3>
<p>Students have the opportunity to run their own departmentally-supported journal, including writing, editing, and publishing. For more information, contact the Comparative Literature undergraduate academic adviser or look for the corresponding DeCal course at DeCal course listings.</p>
<h3>Comparative Literature Research Symposium</h3>
<p>Another opportunity is to participate in the annual Research Symposium, where scholars from around the world discuss their research. Typically the Symposium is held in early April. For more information, contact the Comparative Literature undergraduate academic adviser. </p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Literature is a cultural site where the present is negotiated, the past excavated, and the future envisioned. In a globalized world where the circulation of blogs, legal documents, political manifestos, manuscripts, online journals, and images constantly shapes and reshapes human experience, understanding texts is utterly essential.</p>
<p>Majoring in comparative literature provides students with tools for analyzing texts, writing, editing, translating, and thinking across disciplinary and national boundaries. Our majors engage a variety of literary traditions and historical periods, from Latin American concrete poetry to Yiddish experimental fiction. The department offers rigorous training in the following areas of strength of our internationally recognized faculty: French, German, Italian, Hebrew studies, classics, critical theory, East Asian literatures and arts, performance studies, film and media, poetry and poetics, gender and sexuality, postcolonial theory, English and American literatures, early modern and Renaissance studies and Slavic literatures and cultures.</p>
<p>All members of the department are deeply invested in the academic development of our students and value you as an integral part of the Comparative Literature community at UC Berkeley. The department aims to develop your creative and intellectual interests and talents. As a major, you receive the opportunity to pursue rigorous research in a variety of literatures according to your interests, engage in team-based projects, participate in discussions about political, aesthetic, and social issues, and develop a nuanced cross-cultural understanding of historical and social processes. All of our students have close contact with cutting edge scholars in their fields in a small classroom setting, with extensive individualized work. Our undergraduate majors publish and edit their own journal of comparative literature (CLUJ) and run an annual research conference. Most majors also choose to spend time in study abroad to deepen their cultural and linguistic knowledge.</p>
<p>Our students benefit from training in comparative literature and go on to work in a variety of professions, including journalism, media, publishing, translation, theater, and politics as well as in many roles in the legal, corporate, social, medical, and arts sectors. Additionally, we prepare our students to enter top graduate programs in the US and abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;That is part of the beauty of all literature. You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you are not lonely and isolated from anyone. You belong.&quot;</p>
<p>—F. Scott Fitzgerald</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>If you are thinking of majoring in Comparative Literature, come meet with the major adviser at your earliest opportunity. You will probably discover that the requirements are flexible enough to suit you, and may find it to your advantage to ask the department's adviser to suggest relevant freshman and sophomore courses.</p>
<p>Majors must see the major adviser each semester to plan a program for the coming year in order to pre-enroll via the CalCentral enrollment system. The Major Requirements tab to the right outlines the basic requirements. Keep in mind that most of these requirements will be adjusted according to the language areas in which you plan to work and your own long range plans.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students who have attained junior standing may be admitted to the honors program if they:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have accumulated at least an overall 3.55 grade point average (GPA) and at least a 3.65 GPA in the major.</li>
	<li>Have completed at least 8 upper division units in literature, including <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=COM%20LIT%20100" title="COM LIT 100">COM LIT 100</a> or the equivalent.</li>
	<li>Are prepared to do upper division work in one vernacular foreign literature or one classical literature.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the requirements for the regular program outlined above, candidates for the BA with honors in Comparative Literature must demonstrate, through either examination or coursework, a sense of the historical development of their principal literature, and earn a grade of B or higher for an honors thesis in <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=COM%20LIT%20H195" title="COM LIT H195">COM LIT H195</a>. Students interested in the honors program are urged to consult an adviser in the Department of Comparative Literature at their earliest opportunity.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Comparative Literature has a new minor program, open to all UC Berkeley students regardless of college.  The minor comprises of 5 courses; the 3 &quot;core&quot; classes required for the major (COM LIT 100, CL151-165, and COM LIT 190) along with two courses from the &quot;secondary&quot; literature.  For more information, please review the department site at complit.berkeley.edu or contact the Comparative Literature major adviser at <a href="mailto:complituga@berkeley.edu">complituga@berkeley.edu</a>.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://complit.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Study Abroad</h3>
<p>Many Comparative Literature students study abroad. The department actively encourages this experience. International study can be enlightening and fulfilling, both personally and academically. Although study abroad requires some planning ahead, the benefits are well worth the effort for most students.</p>
<p><a href="http://studyabroad.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Study Abroad (BSA)</a> is a University of California, system-wide program. Located in 160 Stephens Hall, BSA administers education abroad for Berkeley students. To begin planning an overseas program, or for more information, contact an adviser in the BSA Office or phone 510-642-1356.</p>
<p>The Office of Undergraduate Admissions offers assistance to students who want to participate in non-BSA programs. The office at 110 Sproul Hall provides advising during scheduled drop-in hours.</p>
<p>The Department of Comparative Literature expects its students to make normal degree progress and will review standing in the major before approving a semester or year abroad. Advanced consultation with the department adviser is highly recommended.</p>
<h3>Comparative Literature Undergraduate Journal (CLUJ)</h3>
<p>Students have the opportunity to run their own departmentally-supported journal, including writing, editing, and publishing. For more information, contact the Comparative Literature undergraduate academic adviser or look for the corresponding DeCal course at DeCal course listings.</p>
<h3>Comparative Literature Research Symposium</h3>
<p>Another opportunity is to participate in the annual Research Symposium, where scholars from around the world discuss their research. Typically the Symposium is held in early April. For more information, contact the Comparative Literature undergraduate academic adviser. </p>
