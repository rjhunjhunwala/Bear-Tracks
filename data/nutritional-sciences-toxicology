				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology offers three undergraduate major program specializations: Physiology and Metabolism, Dietetics, and Toxicology leading to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree.</p>
<p>Now is an exciting time to explore the sciences of nutrition and toxicology. The media have highlighted many questions about the role of diet in development and aging, the safety of genetically modified foods, links among diet, cancer, and chronic diseases, and the problems of global malnutrition.</p>
<p>The curriculum, driven by NST faculty research, covers a breadth of topics including functions and mechanisms of nutrient actions to the benefits and hazards of chemical agents, cultural and socio-economic determinants of human diets, and development of programs and policies to address human and environmental health and safety.</p>
<h3>Overview of Specialization</h3>
<p>The Nutritional Science: Toxicology degree combines a strong foundation in biological and chemical sciences with specialized advanced courses focusing on the hazardous and beneficial effects of natural and human-made toxic agents. From industrially produced environmental contaminants and designer drugs to herbs and food products, this field of study applies molecular and computational methods to better understand how these agents interact with living organisms and what should be done to ensure human health and safety.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Advice on admission for freshmen and transfer students can be found on the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/#admissionstext" target="_blank">CNR Admissions Guide</a> page or the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/prospective-students" target="_blank">CNR Prospective Student website</a>. Freshman students may apply directly to the major, or they may select the College of Natural Resource's undeclared option and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. Transfer students may apply directly to the major and indicate their intended specialization through the UC application.</p>
<p>Information for current Berkeley students who would like to declare the major after admission, including information on a change of major or change of college, please see chapter 6 of the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">College of Natural Resources Undergraduate Student Handbook</a>.</p>
<h3>CNR Honors Program</h3>
<p>The honors program is individual research, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NUSCTX%20H196" title="NUSCTX H196" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NUSCTX H196');">NUSCTX H196</a></span>, for two semesters under the supervision of a faculty member. The supervised independent honors research is specific to aspects of the nutritional sciences and toxicology major, followed by an oral presentation, and written report. Acceptance in the CNR honors program is required through an application process. Students who are interested in the honors program should apply during their junior or senior year. Students must have a 3.6 grade-point average (GPA) in order to be eligible for the honors program.  Please visit the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/honors-program" target="_blank">CNR Honors webpage</a> or contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall to learn more.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor program in Toxicology. The course work for the minor addresses topics in the basic principles of toxicology and molecular toxicology as well as computational toxicology, pharmacology, and pesticide chemistry. The minor is best suited for students already pursuing a bioscience degree: a background in chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, and biochemistry is necessary to be prepared to do upper division work in this field. For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall.</p>

				<a name="collegerequirementstext"></a><h2>College Requirements</h2><h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>A minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in upper division major requirements is required.</li>
	<li>At least 15 of the 30 required upper division units must be taken in the College of Natural Resources (except for students majoring in Environmental Economics and Policy; please see the EEP major adviser for further information)(NST-Dietetics has 43 upper division requirements).</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of independent study (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, and 199) may count toward graduation, with a maximum of 4 units of independent study per semester.</li>
	<li>No more than 1/3 of the total units attempted at UC Berkeley may be taken Pass/No Pass. This includes units in the Education Abroad Program and UC Intercampus Visitor or Exchange Programs.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 4 units of physical education courses will count toward graduation.</li>
</ol>
<p>For full details around all requirements, please see our <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">Student Handbook</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/reading-composition-requirement/" target="_blank">Reading and Composition</a></p>
<p>In order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing and critical thinking all majors in the College require two semesters of lower division work in composition. Students must complete a first-level reading and composition course by the end of their second semester and a second-level course by the end of their fourth semester.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/foreign-language-requirement/" target="_blank">Foreign Language</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Foreign Language requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. It may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/quantitative-reasoning-requirement/" target="_blank">Quantitative Reasoning</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Quantitative Reasoning requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Breadth</h3>
<p>Undergraduate breadth provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program and many students complete their breadth courses in their first two years. Breadth courses are built into CNR major requirements and each major requires a different number of breadth courses and categories. The EEP major is the only CNR major that requires the entire 7 course breadth. Refer to the major snapshots on each <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/majors-minors" target="_blank">CNR major page</a> for for additional information.</p>
<h3>High School Exam Credit</h3>
<p>CNR students may apply high school exam credit (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-Level Exam) towards many College and Major Requirements. See <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/courses-grades#AP%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chat" target="_blank">AP Exam Equivalency Chart and Higher Level IB Exam Equivalency Chart</a> in the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">CNR Student Handbook</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Units Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</li>
	<li>At least 36 units must be upper division courses, including a minimum of 15 units of upper division courses in the College of Natural Resources.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) is allowed towards the 120 units; a maximum of four is allowed in a given semester.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 4 units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li>
	<li>Students may receive unit credit for courses graded P (including P/NP units taken through EAP) up to a limit of one-third of the total units taken and passed on the Berkeley campus at the time of graduation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Semester Unit Minimum</h4>
<p>All CNR students must enroll in at least 13 units each fall and spring semester</p>
<h4>Semester Unit Maximum</h4>
<p>To request permission to take more than 19.5 units in a semester, please see the major adviser.</p>
<h3>Semester Limit</h3>
<p>Students admitted as freshmen must graduate within 8 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students admitted as transfer students must graduate within 4 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students who go on EAP and UCDC can petition for additional semesters. Summer session, UC Extension and non-UC study abroad programs do not count towards this semester limit. Students approved for double majors or  simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester. CNR does not limit the number of total units a student can accrue.</p>
<h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>After the term in which you achieve and exceed 90 units (senior status), you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence at the College of Natural Resources over at least 2 semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units taken while the student is a member of CNR. At least one of the two terms must be a fall or spring semester. Senior residence terms do not need to be completed consecutively. All courses offered on campus for the fall, spring, and summer terms by Berkeley departments and programs and all Berkeley online ('W') courses count. Inter-campus Visitor, Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley Washington Program, and UC Berkeley Extension units do not count toward this requirement.</p>
<p>Students may use Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that four units of coursework are completed.</p>
<h3>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>Participants in a fall, spring or summer UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, or the UC Berkeley Washington Program may meet a modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 of their final 60 semester units in residence (excluding UCEAP). At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after senior status is reached. International travel study programs sponsored by Summer Sessions and education abroad programs offered outside of the UC system do not qualify for modified senior residence.</p>
<p>Most students automatically satisfy the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year. In these cases, students should make an appointment to see an adviser to determine how they can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.</p>
<h3>Grade Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A 2.0 UC GPA is required for graduation.</li>
	<li>A 2.0 average in all upper division courses required of the major program is required for graduation.</li>
	<li>A grade of at least C- is required in all courses for the major.</li>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology offers three undergraduate major program specializations: Physiology and Metabolism, Dietetics, and Toxicology leading to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree.</p>
<p>Now is an exciting time to explore the sciences of nutrition and toxicology. The media have highlighted many questions about the role of diet in development and aging, the safety of genetically modified foods, links among diet, cancer, and chronic diseases, and the problems of global malnutrition.</p>
<p>The curriculum, driven by NST faculty research, covers a breadth of topics including functions and mechanisms of nutrient actions to the benefits and hazards of chemical agents, cultural and socio-economic determinants of human diets, and development of programs and policies to address human and environmental health and safety.</p>
<h3>Overview of Specialization</h3>
<p>The Nutritional Science: Toxicology degree combines a strong foundation in biological and chemical sciences with specialized advanced courses focusing on the hazardous and beneficial effects of natural and human-made toxic agents. From industrially produced environmental contaminants and designer drugs to herbs and food products, this field of study applies molecular and computational methods to better understand how these agents interact with living organisms and what should be done to ensure human health and safety.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Advice on admission for freshmen and transfer students can be found on the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/#admissionstext" target="_blank">CNR Admissions Guide</a> page or the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/prospective-students" target="_blank">CNR Prospective Student website</a>. Freshman students may apply directly to the major, or they may select the College of Natural Resource's undeclared option and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. Transfer students may apply directly to the major and indicate their intended specialization through the UC application.</p>
<p>Information for current Berkeley students who would like to declare the major after admission, including information on a change of major or change of college, please see chapter 6 of the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">College of Natural Resources Undergraduate Student Handbook</a>.</p>
<h3>CNR Honors Program</h3>
<p>The honors program is individual research, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NUSCTX%20H196" title="NUSCTX H196" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NUSCTX H196');">NUSCTX H196</a></span>, for two semesters under the supervision of a faculty member. The supervised independent honors research is specific to aspects of the nutritional sciences and toxicology major, followed by an oral presentation, and written report. Acceptance in the CNR honors program is required through an application process. Students who are interested in the honors program should apply during their junior or senior year. Students must have a 3.6 grade-point average (GPA) in order to be eligible for the honors program.  Please visit the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/honors-program" target="_blank">CNR Honors webpage</a> or contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall to learn more.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor program in Toxicology. The course work for the minor addresses topics in the basic principles of toxicology and molecular toxicology as well as computational toxicology, pharmacology, and pesticide chemistry. The minor is best suited for students already pursuing a bioscience degree: a background in chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, and biochemistry is necessary to be prepared to do upper division work in this field. For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall.</p>

				<a name="collegerequirementstext"></a><h2>College Requirements</h2><h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>A minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in upper division major requirements is required.</li>
	<li>At least 15 of the 30 required upper division units must be taken in the College of Natural Resources (except for students majoring in Environmental Economics and Policy; please see the EEP major adviser for further information)(NST-Dietetics has 43 upper division requirements).</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of independent study (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, and 199) may count toward graduation, with a maximum of 4 units of independent study per semester.</li>
	<li>No more than 1/3 of the total units attempted at UC Berkeley may be taken Pass/No Pass. This includes units in the Education Abroad Program and UC Intercampus Visitor or Exchange Programs.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 4 units of physical education courses will count toward graduation.</li>
</ol>
<p>For full details around all requirements, please see our <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">Student Handbook</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/reading-composition-requirement/" target="_blank">Reading and Composition</a></p>
<p>In order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing and critical thinking all majors in the College require two semesters of lower division work in composition. Students must complete a first-level reading and composition course by the end of their second semester and a second-level course by the end of their fourth semester.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/foreign-language-requirement/" target="_blank">Foreign Language</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Foreign Language requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. It may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/quantitative-reasoning-requirement/" target="_blank">Quantitative Reasoning</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Quantitative Reasoning requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Breadth</h3>
<p>Undergraduate breadth provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program and many students complete their breadth courses in their first two years. Breadth courses are built into CNR major requirements and each major requires a different number of breadth courses and categories. The EEP major is the only CNR major that requires the entire 7 course breadth. Refer to the major snapshots on each <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/majors-minors" target="_blank">CNR major page</a> for for additional information.</p>
<h3>High School Exam Credit</h3>
<p>CNR students may apply high school exam credit (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-Level Exam) towards many College and Major Requirements. See <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/courses-grades#AP%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chat" target="_blank">AP Exam Equivalency Chart and Higher Level IB Exam Equivalency Chart</a> in the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">CNR Student Handbook</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Units Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</li>
	<li>At least 36 units must be upper division courses, including a minimum of 15 units of upper division courses in the College of Natural Resources.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) is allowed towards the 120 units; a maximum of four is allowed in a given semester.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 4 units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li>
	<li>Students may receive unit credit for courses graded P (including P/NP units taken through EAP) up to a limit of one-third of the total units taken and passed on the Berkeley campus at the time of graduation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Semester Unit Minimum</h4>
<p>All CNR students must enroll in at least 13 units each fall and spring semester</p>
<h4>Semester Unit Maximum</h4>
<p>To request permission to take more than 19.5 units in a semester, please see the major adviser.</p>
<h3>Semester Limit</h3>
<p>Students admitted as freshmen must graduate within 8 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students admitted as transfer students must graduate within 4 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students who go on EAP and UCDC can petition for additional semesters. Summer session, UC Extension and non-UC study abroad programs do not count towards this semester limit. Students approved for double majors or  simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester. CNR does not limit the number of total units a student can accrue.</p>
<h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>After the term in which you achieve and exceed 90 units (senior status), you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence at the College of Natural Resources over at least 2 semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units taken while the student is a member of CNR. At least one of the two terms must be a fall or spring semester. Senior residence terms do not need to be completed consecutively. All courses offered on campus for the fall, spring, and summer terms by Berkeley departments and programs and all Berkeley online ('W') courses count. Inter-campus Visitor, Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley Washington Program, and UC Berkeley Extension units do not count toward this requirement.</p>
<p>Students may use Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that four units of coursework are completed.</p>
<h3>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>Participants in a fall, spring or summer UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, or the UC Berkeley Washington Program may meet a modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 of their final 60 semester units in residence (excluding UCEAP). At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after senior status is reached. International travel study programs sponsored by Summer Sessions and education abroad programs offered outside of the UC system do not qualify for modified senior residence.</p>
<p>Most students automatically satisfy the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year. In these cases, students should make an appointment to see an adviser to determine how they can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.</p>
<h3>Grade Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A 2.0 UC GPA is required for graduation.</li>
	<li>A 2.0 average in all upper division courses required of the major program is required for graduation.</li>
	<li>A grade of at least C- is required in all courses for the major.</li>
</ul>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology offers three undergraduate major program specializations: Physiology and Metabolism, Dietetics, and Toxicology leading to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree.</p>
<p>Now is an exciting time to explore the sciences of nutrition and toxicology. The media have highlighted many questions about the role of diet in development and aging, the safety of genetically modified foods, links among diet, cancer, and chronic diseases, and the problems of global malnutrition.</p>
<p>The curriculum, driven by NST faculty research, covers a breadth of topics including functions and mechanisms of nutrient actions to the benefits and hazards of chemical agents, cultural and socio-economic determinants of human diets, and development of programs and policies to address human and environmental health and safety.</p>
<h3>Overview of Specialization</h3>
<p>The Nutritional Science: Toxicology degree combines a strong foundation in biological and chemical sciences with specialized advanced courses focusing on the hazardous and beneficial effects of natural and human-made toxic agents. From industrially produced environmental contaminants and designer drugs to herbs and food products, this field of study applies molecular and computational methods to better understand how these agents interact with living organisms and what should be done to ensure human health and safety.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Advice on admission for freshmen and transfer students can be found on the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/#admissionstext" target="_blank">CNR Admissions Guide</a> page or the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/prospective-students" target="_blank">CNR Prospective Student website</a>. Freshman students may apply directly to the major, or they may select the College of Natural Resource's undeclared option and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. Transfer students may apply directly to the major and indicate their intended specialization through the UC application.</p>
<p>Information for current Berkeley students who would like to declare the major after admission, including information on a change of major or change of college, please see chapter 6 of the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">College of Natural Resources Undergraduate Student Handbook</a>.</p>
<h3>CNR Honors Program</h3>
<p>The honors program is individual research, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NUSCTX%20H196" title="NUSCTX H196" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NUSCTX H196');">NUSCTX H196</a></span>, for two semesters under the supervision of a faculty member. The supervised independent honors research is specific to aspects of the nutritional sciences and toxicology major, followed by an oral presentation, and written report. Acceptance in the CNR honors program is required through an application process. Students who are interested in the honors program should apply during their junior or senior year. Students must have a 3.6 grade-point average (GPA) in order to be eligible for the honors program.  Please visit the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/honors-program" target="_blank">CNR Honors webpage</a> or contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall to learn more.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor program in Toxicology. The course work for the minor addresses topics in the basic principles of toxicology and molecular toxicology as well as computational toxicology, pharmacology, and pesticide chemistry. The minor is best suited for students already pursuing a bioscience degree: a background in chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, and biochemistry is necessary to be prepared to do upper division work in this field. For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall.</p>

				<a name="collegerequirementstext"></a><h2>College Requirements</h2><h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>A minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in upper division major requirements is required.</li>
	<li>At least 15 of the 30 required upper division units must be taken in the College of Natural Resources (except for students majoring in Environmental Economics and Policy; please see the EEP major adviser for further information)(NST-Dietetics has 43 upper division requirements).</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of independent study (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, and 199) may count toward graduation, with a maximum of 4 units of independent study per semester.</li>
	<li>No more than 1/3 of the total units attempted at UC Berkeley may be taken Pass/No Pass. This includes units in the Education Abroad Program and UC Intercampus Visitor or Exchange Programs.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 4 units of physical education courses will count toward graduation.</li>
</ol>
<p>For full details around all requirements, please see our <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">Student Handbook</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/reading-composition-requirement/" target="_blank">Reading and Composition</a></p>
<p>In order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing and critical thinking all majors in the College require two semesters of lower division work in composition. Students must complete a first-level reading and composition course by the end of their second semester and a second-level course by the end of their fourth semester.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/foreign-language-requirement/" target="_blank">Foreign Language</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Foreign Language requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. It may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/quantitative-reasoning-requirement/" target="_blank">Quantitative Reasoning</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Quantitative Reasoning requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Breadth</h3>
<p>Undergraduate breadth provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program and many students complete their breadth courses in their first two years. Breadth courses are built into CNR major requirements and each major requires a different number of breadth courses and categories. The EEP major is the only CNR major that requires the entire 7 course breadth. Refer to the major snapshots on each <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/majors-minors" target="_blank">CNR major page</a> for for additional information.</p>
<h3>High School Exam Credit</h3>
<p>CNR students may apply high school exam credit (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-Level Exam) towards many College and Major Requirements. See <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/courses-grades#AP%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chat" target="_blank">AP Exam Equivalency Chart and Higher Level IB Exam Equivalency Chart</a> in the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">CNR Student Handbook</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Units Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</li>
	<li>At least 36 units must be upper division courses, including a minimum of 15 units of upper division courses in the College of Natural Resources.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) is allowed towards the 120 units; a maximum of four is allowed in a given semester.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 4 units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li>
	<li>Students may receive unit credit for courses graded P (including P/NP units taken through EAP) up to a limit of one-third of the total units taken and passed on the Berkeley campus at the time of graduation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Semester Unit Minimum</h4>
<p>All CNR students must enroll in at least 13 units each fall and spring semester</p>
<h4>Semester Unit Maximum</h4>
<p>To request permission to take more than 19.5 units in a semester, please see the major adviser.</p>
<h3>Semester Limit</h3>
<p>Students admitted as freshmen must graduate within 8 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students admitted as transfer students must graduate within 4 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students who go on EAP and UCDC can petition for additional semesters. Summer session, UC Extension and non-UC study abroad programs do not count towards this semester limit. Students approved for double majors or  simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester. CNR does not limit the number of total units a student can accrue.</p>
<h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>After the term in which you achieve and exceed 90 units (senior status), you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence at the College of Natural Resources over at least 2 semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units taken while the student is a member of CNR. At least one of the two terms must be a fall or spring semester. Senior residence terms do not need to be completed consecutively. All courses offered on campus for the fall, spring, and summer terms by Berkeley departments and programs and all Berkeley online ('W') courses count. Inter-campus Visitor, Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley Washington Program, and UC Berkeley Extension units do not count toward this requirement.</p>
<p>Students may use Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that four units of coursework are completed.</p>
<h3>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>Participants in a fall, spring or summer UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, or the UC Berkeley Washington Program may meet a modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 of their final 60 semester units in residence (excluding UCEAP). At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after senior status is reached. International travel study programs sponsored by Summer Sessions and education abroad programs offered outside of the UC system do not qualify for modified senior residence.</p>
<p>Most students automatically satisfy the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year. In these cases, students should make an appointment to see an adviser to determine how they can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.</p>
<h3>Grade Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A 2.0 UC GPA is required for graduation.</li>
	<li>A 2.0 average in all upper division courses required of the major program is required for graduation.</li>
	<li>A grade of at least C- is required in all courses for the major.</li>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology offers three undergraduate major program specializations: Physiology and Metabolism, Dietetics, and Toxicology leading to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree.</p>
<p>Now is an exciting time to explore the sciences of nutrition and toxicology. The media have highlighted many questions about the role of diet in development and aging, the safety of genetically modified foods, links among diet, cancer, and chronic diseases, and the problems of global malnutrition.</p>
<p>The curriculum, driven by NST faculty research, covers a breadth of topics including functions and mechanisms of nutrient actions to the benefits and hazards of chemical agents, cultural and socio-economic determinants of human diets, and development of programs and policies to address human and environmental health and safety.</p>
<h3>Overview of Specialization</h3>
<p>The Nutritional Science: Toxicology degree combines a strong foundation in biological and chemical sciences with specialized advanced courses focusing on the hazardous and beneficial effects of natural and human-made toxic agents. From industrially produced environmental contaminants and designer drugs to herbs and food products, this field of study applies molecular and computational methods to better understand how these agents interact with living organisms and what should be done to ensure human health and safety.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Advice on admission for freshmen and transfer students can be found on the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/#admissionstext" target="_blank">CNR Admissions Guide</a> page or the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/prospective-students" target="_blank">CNR Prospective Student website</a>. Freshman students may apply directly to the major, or they may select the College of Natural Resource's undeclared option and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. Transfer students may apply directly to the major and indicate their intended specialization through the UC application.</p>
<p>Information for current Berkeley students who would like to declare the major after admission, including information on a change of major or change of college, please see chapter 6 of the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">College of Natural Resources Undergraduate Student Handbook</a>.</p>
<h3>CNR Honors Program</h3>
<p>The honors program is individual research, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NUSCTX%20H196" title="NUSCTX H196" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NUSCTX H196');">NUSCTX H196</a></span>, for two semesters under the supervision of a faculty member. The supervised independent honors research is specific to aspects of the nutritional sciences and toxicology major, followed by an oral presentation, and written report. Acceptance in the CNR honors program is required through an application process. Students who are interested in the honors program should apply during their junior or senior year. Students must have a 3.6 grade-point average (GPA) in order to be eligible for the honors program.  Please visit the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/honors-program" target="_blank">CNR Honors webpage</a> or contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall to learn more.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor program in Toxicology. The course work for the minor addresses topics in the basic principles of toxicology and molecular toxicology as well as computational toxicology, pharmacology, and pesticide chemistry. The minor is best suited for students already pursuing a bioscience degree: a background in chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, and biochemistry is necessary to be prepared to do upper division work in this field. For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall.</p>

				<a name="collegerequirementstext"></a><h2>College Requirements</h2><h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>A minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in upper division major requirements is required.</li>
	<li>At least 15 of the 30 required upper division units must be taken in the College of Natural Resources (except for students majoring in Environmental Economics and Policy; please see the EEP major adviser for further information)(NST-Dietetics has 43 upper division requirements).</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of independent study (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, and 199) may count toward graduation, with a maximum of 4 units of independent study per semester.</li>
	<li>No more than 1/3 of the total units attempted at UC Berkeley may be taken Pass/No Pass. This includes units in the Education Abroad Program and UC Intercampus Visitor or Exchange Programs.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 4 units of physical education courses will count toward graduation.</li>
</ol>
<p>For full details around all requirements, please see our <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">Student Handbook</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/reading-composition-requirement/" target="_blank">Reading and Composition</a></p>
<p>In order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing and critical thinking all majors in the College require two semesters of lower division work in composition. Students must complete a first-level reading and composition course by the end of their second semester and a second-level course by the end of their fourth semester.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/foreign-language-requirement/" target="_blank">Foreign Language</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Foreign Language requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. It may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/quantitative-reasoning-requirement/" target="_blank">Quantitative Reasoning</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Quantitative Reasoning requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Breadth</h3>
<p>Undergraduate breadth provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program and many students complete their breadth courses in their first two years. Breadth courses are built into CNR major requirements and each major requires a different number of breadth courses and categories. The EEP major is the only CNR major that requires the entire 7 course breadth. Refer to the major snapshots on each <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/majors-minors" target="_blank">CNR major page</a> for for additional information.</p>
<h3>High School Exam Credit</h3>
<p>CNR students may apply high school exam credit (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-Level Exam) towards many College and Major Requirements. See <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/courses-grades#AP%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chat" target="_blank">AP Exam Equivalency Chart and Higher Level IB Exam Equivalency Chart</a> in the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">CNR Student Handbook</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Units Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</li>
	<li>At least 36 units must be upper division courses, including a minimum of 15 units of upper division courses in the College of Natural Resources.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) is allowed towards the 120 units; a maximum of four is allowed in a given semester.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 4 units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li>
	<li>Students may receive unit credit for courses graded P (including P/NP units taken through EAP) up to a limit of one-third of the total units taken and passed on the Berkeley campus at the time of graduation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Semester Unit Minimum</h4>
<p>All CNR students must enroll in at least 13 units each fall and spring semester</p>
<h4>Semester Unit Maximum</h4>
<p>To request permission to take more than 19.5 units in a semester, please see the major adviser.</p>
<h3>Semester Limit</h3>
<p>Students admitted as freshmen must graduate within 8 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students admitted as transfer students must graduate within 4 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students who go on EAP and UCDC can petition for additional semesters. Summer session, UC Extension and non-UC study abroad programs do not count towards this semester limit. Students approved for double majors or  simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester. CNR does not limit the number of total units a student can accrue.</p>
<h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>After the term in which you achieve and exceed 90 units (senior status), you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence at the College of Natural Resources over at least 2 semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units taken while the student is a member of CNR. At least one of the two terms must be a fall or spring semester. Senior residence terms do not need to be completed consecutively. All courses offered on campus for the fall, spring, and summer terms by Berkeley departments and programs and all Berkeley online ('W') courses count. Inter-campus Visitor, Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley Washington Program, and UC Berkeley Extension units do not count toward this requirement.</p>
<p>Students may use Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that four units of coursework are completed.</p>
<h3>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>Participants in a fall, spring or summer UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, or the UC Berkeley Washington Program may meet a modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 of their final 60 semester units in residence (excluding UCEAP). At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after senior status is reached. International travel study programs sponsored by Summer Sessions and education abroad programs offered outside of the UC system do not qualify for modified senior residence.</p>
<p>Most students automatically satisfy the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year. In these cases, students should make an appointment to see an adviser to determine how they can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.</p>
<h3>Grade Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A 2.0 UC GPA is required for graduation.</li>
	<li>A 2.0 average in all upper division courses required of the major program is required for graduation.</li>
	<li>A grade of at least C- is required in all courses for the major.</li>
</ul>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology offers three undergraduate major program specializations: Physiology and Metabolism, Dietetics, and Toxicology leading to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree.</p>
<p>Now is an exciting time to explore the sciences of nutrition and toxicology. The media have highlighted many questions about the role of diet in development and aging, the safety of genetically modified foods, links among diet, cancer, and chronic diseases, and the problems of global malnutrition.</p>
<p>The curriculum, driven by NST faculty research, covers a breadth of topics including functions and mechanisms of nutrient actions to the benefits and hazards of chemical agents, cultural and socio-economic determinants of human diets, and development of programs and policies to address human and environmental health and safety.</p>
<h3>Overview of Specialization</h3>
<p>The Nutritional Science: Toxicology degree combines a strong foundation in biological and chemical sciences with specialized advanced courses focusing on the hazardous and beneficial effects of natural and human-made toxic agents. From industrially produced environmental contaminants and designer drugs to herbs and food products, this field of study applies molecular and computational methods to better understand how these agents interact with living organisms and what should be done to ensure human health and safety.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Advice on admission for freshmen and transfer students can be found on the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/#admissionstext" target="_blank">CNR Admissions Guide</a> page or the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/prospective-students" target="_blank">CNR Prospective Student website</a>. Freshman students may apply directly to the major, or they may select the College of Natural Resource's undeclared option and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. Transfer students may apply directly to the major and indicate their intended specialization through the UC application.</p>
<p>Information for current Berkeley students who would like to declare the major after admission, including information on a change of major or change of college, please see chapter 6 of the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">College of Natural Resources Undergraduate Student Handbook</a>.</p>
<h3>CNR Honors Program</h3>
<p>The honors program is individual research, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NUSCTX%20H196" title="NUSCTX H196" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NUSCTX H196');">NUSCTX H196</a></span>, for two semesters under the supervision of a faculty member. The supervised independent honors research is specific to aspects of the nutritional sciences and toxicology major, followed by an oral presentation, and written report. Acceptance in the CNR honors program is required through an application process. Students who are interested in the honors program should apply during their junior or senior year. Students must have a 3.6 grade-point average (GPA) in order to be eligible for the honors program.  Please visit the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/honors-program" target="_blank">CNR Honors webpage</a> or contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall to learn more.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor program in Toxicology. The course work for the minor addresses topics in the basic principles of toxicology and molecular toxicology as well as computational toxicology, pharmacology, and pesticide chemistry. The minor is best suited for students already pursuing a bioscience degree: a background in chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, and biochemistry is necessary to be prepared to do upper division work in this field. For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall.</p>

				<a name="collegerequirementstext"></a><h2>College Requirements</h2><h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>A minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in upper division major requirements is required.</li>
	<li>At least 15 of the 30 required upper division units must be taken in the College of Natural Resources (except for students majoring in Environmental Economics and Policy; please see the EEP major adviser for further information)(NST-Dietetics has 43 upper division requirements).</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of independent study (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, and 199) may count toward graduation, with a maximum of 4 units of independent study per semester.</li>
	<li>No more than 1/3 of the total units attempted at UC Berkeley may be taken Pass/No Pass. This includes units in the Education Abroad Program and UC Intercampus Visitor or Exchange Programs.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 4 units of physical education courses will count toward graduation.</li>
</ol>
<p>For full details around all requirements, please see our <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">Student Handbook</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/reading-composition-requirement/" target="_blank">Reading and Composition</a></p>
<p>In order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing and critical thinking all majors in the College require two semesters of lower division work in composition. Students must complete a first-level reading and composition course by the end of their second semester and a second-level course by the end of their fourth semester.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/foreign-language-requirement/" target="_blank">Foreign Language</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Foreign Language requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. It may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/quantitative-reasoning-requirement/" target="_blank">Quantitative Reasoning</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Quantitative Reasoning requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Breadth</h3>
<p>Undergraduate breadth provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program and many students complete their breadth courses in their first two years. Breadth courses are built into CNR major requirements and each major requires a different number of breadth courses and categories. The EEP major is the only CNR major that requires the entire 7 course breadth. Refer to the major snapshots on each <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/majors-minors" target="_blank">CNR major page</a> for for additional information.</p>
<h3>High School Exam Credit</h3>
<p>CNR students may apply high school exam credit (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-Level Exam) towards many College and Major Requirements. See <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/courses-grades#AP%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chat" target="_blank">AP Exam Equivalency Chart and Higher Level IB Exam Equivalency Chart</a> in the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">CNR Student Handbook</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Units Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</li>
	<li>At least 36 units must be upper division courses, including a minimum of 15 units of upper division courses in the College of Natural Resources.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) is allowed towards the 120 units; a maximum of four is allowed in a given semester.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 4 units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li>
	<li>Students may receive unit credit for courses graded P (including P/NP units taken through EAP) up to a limit of one-third of the total units taken and passed on the Berkeley campus at the time of graduation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Semester Unit Minimum</h4>
<p>All CNR students must enroll in at least 13 units each fall and spring semester</p>
<h4>Semester Unit Maximum</h4>
<p>To request permission to take more than 19.5 units in a semester, please see the major adviser.</p>
<h3>Semester Limit</h3>
<p>Students admitted as freshmen must graduate within 8 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students admitted as transfer students must graduate within 4 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students who go on EAP and UCDC can petition for additional semesters. Summer session, UC Extension and non-UC study abroad programs do not count towards this semester limit. Students approved for double majors or  simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester. CNR does not limit the number of total units a student can accrue.</p>
<h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>After the term in which you achieve and exceed 90 units (senior status), you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence at the College of Natural Resources over at least 2 semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units taken while the student is a member of CNR. At least one of the two terms must be a fall or spring semester. Senior residence terms do not need to be completed consecutively. All courses offered on campus for the fall, spring, and summer terms by Berkeley departments and programs and all Berkeley online ('W') courses count. Inter-campus Visitor, Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley Washington Program, and UC Berkeley Extension units do not count toward this requirement.</p>
<p>Students may use Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that four units of coursework are completed.</p>
<h3>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>Participants in a fall, spring or summer UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, or the UC Berkeley Washington Program may meet a modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 of their final 60 semester units in residence (excluding UCEAP). At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after senior status is reached. International travel study programs sponsored by Summer Sessions and education abroad programs offered outside of the UC system do not qualify for modified senior residence.</p>
<p>Most students automatically satisfy the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year. In these cases, students should make an appointment to see an adviser to determine how they can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.</p>
<h3>Grade Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A 2.0 UC GPA is required for graduation.</li>
	<li>A 2.0 average in all upper division courses required of the major program is required for graduation.</li>
	<li>A grade of at least C- is required in all courses for the major.</li>
