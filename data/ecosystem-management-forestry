<h3><span>Bachelor of Science (BS) </span></h3>
<div>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-8eaff4c5-7330-32cb-c283-5ef7c84edeab">Ecosystem Management and Forestry (EMF)  focuses on the conservation and restoration of the earth's natural resources through hands-on study of the ecology, stewardship, and management of forest, woodland, and grassland ecosystems. </span></p>
<p>The program offers two specializations to choose from, and if the student chooses a specialization in Forestry, they can qualify to take the Registered Professional Forester's licensing exam in California.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>Forestry specialization</strong> provides students with the ecological, quantitative, and social foundation to be the managers and leaders in the management of forests and forest resources.  The Forestry specialization is accredited by the Society of American Foresters and provides four years of qualifying education or professional experience for licensing as a professional forester in California. The goals of the Forestry specialization are very closely associated with the educational requirements of the forestry profession and prepare our students for a variety of careers in forestry or closely related natural resource fields.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Natural Resource Management specialization</strong> provides students with greater flexibility to explore subjects in ecology, physical environment, monitoring and measurement, and management and policy.  Students can choose to concentrate their studies in water management, ecology, climates change or design their own concentration based on interest.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-8eaff4c5-7330-32cb-c283-5ef7c84edeab">Students in the program, regardless of concentration, have ample opportunity to acquire interdisciplinary skills in the ecology, stewardship, and management of ecosystems such as forests, woodlands, and grasslands. Within the program, students can choose to emphasize topics such as wildlife biology, water policy, fire science, ecosystem restoration, environmental justice, remote sensing and GIS, and rural sociology.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-8eaff4c5-7330-32cb-c283-5ef7c84edeab">EMF graduates are well-prepared for graduate school and careers in environmental consulting, public agencies, non-profit conservation organizations, and private companies. Students also have the option of preparing for professional careers in forestry, wildlife, and range management.</span></p>
<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-8eaff4c5-7330-32cb-c283-5ef7c84edeab">Admission to the Major</span></h3>
<p>Advice on admission for freshmen and transfer students can be found on the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/#admissionstext" target="_blank">CNR Admissions Guide</a> page or the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/prospective-students" target="_blank">CNR Prospective Student website</a>. Freshman students may apply directly to the major, or they may select the College of Natural Resource's undeclared option and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. Transfer students may apply directly to the major through the UC application.</p>
<p>Information for current Berkeley students who would like to declare the major after admission, including information on a change of major or change of college, please see chapter 6 of the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">College of Natural Resources Undergraduate Student Handbook</a><a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook">.</a></p>
<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-8eaff4c5-7330-32cb-c283-5ef7c84edeab">Honors Program</span></h3>
<div>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-8eaff4c5-7330-a6b1-8685-64e3ed4142ad">Students with a GPA of 3.6 or higher may enroll in the College of Natural Resources honors program (H196) once they have reached upper division standing. To fulfill the program requirements, students design, conduct, and report on an individual research project working with a faculty sponsor. For further information about registration for the honors symposium and the honors requirements, please see the </span><a href="http://nature.berkeley.edu/site/honors_program.php">College of Natural Resources website</a>.</p>
<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-8eaff4c5-7330-a6b1-8685-64e3ed4142ad">Minor Program</span></h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-8eaff4c5-7330-a6b1-8685-64e3ed4142ad">A minor in Forestry is available for students who are interested in learning about forestry and renewable resource management as an adjunct to their chosen fields. Students in many diverse majors such as business administration, integrative biology, and civil engineering may find this minor complementary to their professional career goals. For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the department.</span></p>

<h4><strong>Forestry Specialization Requirements</strong></h4>
<p>The Forestry specialization provides students with the ecological, quantitative, and social foundation to be the managers and leaders in the management of forests and forest resources.  The Forestry specialization is accredited by the Society of American Foresters and provides four years of qualifying education or professional experience for licensing as a professional forester in California. The goals of the Forestry specialization are very closely associated with the educational requirements of the forestry profession and prepare our students for a variety of  careers in forestry or closely related natural resource fields.</p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-88b6b7bf-9719-8ce4-e3ad-c40196f6f448">The Ecosystem Management and Forestry (EMF) major at the University of California at Berkeley is designed to train tomorrow’s leaders in ecosystem science, policy, and management with an emphasis on the ecology, stewardship, and management of forest, woodland, and grassland ecosystems.  The program combines a foundation in the relevant natural and social sciences with explicit hands-on learning opportunities. Students completing this major will be prepared to engage policymakers and the public on the role and value of nature in our rapidly changing world.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-88b6b7bf-9719-8ce4-e3ad-c40196f6f448">The EMF major includes both a Forestry concentration that is accredited by the Society of American Foresters (SAF) and Natural Resource Management (NRM) concentration (</span>SAF accreditation pending)</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-88b6b7bf-9719-8ce4-e3ad-c40196f6f448">The Forestry concentration provides four years of qualifying education or professional experience for licensing as a professional forester in California. The goals of the Professional Forestry specialization are very closely associated with the educational requirements of the forestry profession and prepare our students for careers in forestry or closely related natural resource fields. When students graduate the EMF major with a Forestry concentration from UC Berkeley, they will have the basic knowledge and skills to assess and manage forest resources.  </span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-88b6b7bf-9719-8ce4-e3ad-c40196f6f448">The Natural Resource Management concentration trains students how to solve ecosystem problems that require interdisciplinary skills. Students can choose to emphasize such topics as wildlife biology, water policy, fire science, ecosystem restoration, environmental justice, remote sensing, and GIS, or rural sociology. Students who graduate the EMF major with an NRM concentration are well-positioned tack current environmental challenges (climate change, fire, sudden oak death, exurban development, drought, and novel ecosystems) while working industry, government or environmental organizations. </span></p>
