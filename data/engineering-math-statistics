				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Engineering Mathematics and Statistics major offered through the Engineering Science Program offers students an opportunity to study pure and applied mathematics as essential components of modern engineering. By combining courses in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics, the physical sciences, and engineering, a student may individualize a program of study, of theory, or of applications of both. It provides a broad foundation for graduate studies in theoretical branches of engineering, as well as in mathematics, and can prepare students for a career in specific sectors of industry or business.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering Science degree programs via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is competitive as there are few — if any — spaces available in this major for students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change to College of Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Engineering Mathematics and Statistics.</p>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement. These courses focus upon how the diversity of America's constituent cultural traditions have shaped and continue to shape American identity and experience.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Visit the </span><a href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a> or the <a href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/">American Cultures website</a> for the specific American Cultures courses offered each semester.

The course is concerned with giving students the tools to prepare for the fields and jobs of the future.<br/>
Across all university departments and majors, the numbers of students who do not work in the fields in which they’ve received their degrees is not only significant, but growing. For example, anywhere from 20-40% of STEM graduates do not work in the fields in which they received their degrees.<br/>
This does not mean that students shouldn’t major in STEM, but</span><span class="deschide"> that one of the primary purposes of higher education is learning how to learn. Accordingly, this course presents a number of frameworks that are critical for thinking about that which has not yet been invented.<br/></span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Engineering Mathematics and Statistics major offered through the Engineering Science Program offers students an opportunity to study pure and applied mathematics as essential components of modern engineering. By combining courses in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics, the physical sciences, and engineering, a student may individualize a program of study, of theory, or of applications of both. It provides a broad foundation for graduate studies in theoretical branches of engineering, as well as in mathematics, and can prepare students for a career in specific sectors of industry or business.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering Science degree programs via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is competitive as there are few — if any — spaces available in this major for students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change to College of Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Engineering Mathematics and Statistics.</p>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement. These courses focus upon how the diversity of America's constituent cultural traditions have shaped and continue to shape American identity and experience.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Visit the </span><a href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a> or the <a href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/">American Cultures website</a> for the specific American Cultures courses offered each semester. For a complete list of approved American Cultures courses at UC Berkeley and California Community Colleges, please see the <a href="https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/amcult">American Cultures Subcommittee’s website</a>.

The course is concerned with giving students the tools to prepare for the fields and jobs of the future.<br/>
Across all university departments and majors, the numbers of students who do not work in the fields in which they’ve received their degrees is not only significant, but growing. For example, anywhere from 20-40% of STEM graduates do not work in the fields in which they received their degrees.<br/>
This does not mean that students shouldn’t major in STEM, but</span><span class="deschide"> that one of the primary purposes of higher education is learning how to learn. Accordingly, this course presents a number of frameworks that are critical for thinking about that which has not yet been invented.<br/></span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Engineering Mathematics and Statistics major offered through the Engineering Science Program offers students an opportunity to study pure and applied mathematics as essential components of modern engineering. By combining courses in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics, the physical sciences, and engineering, a student may individualize a program of study, of theory, or of applications of both. It provides a broad foundation for graduate studies in theoretical branches of engineering, as well as in mathematics, and can prepare students for a career in specific sectors of industry or business.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering Science degree programs via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is competitive as there are few — if any — spaces available in this major for students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change to College of Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Engineering Mathematics and Statistics.</p>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement. These courses focus upon how the diversity of America's constituent cultural traditions have shaped and continue to shape American identity and experience.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Visit the </span><a href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a> or the <a href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/">American Cultures website</a> for the specific American Cultures courses offered each semester. For a complete list of approved American Cultures courses at UC Berkeley and California Community Colleges, please see the <a href="https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/amcult">American Cultures Subcommittee’s website</a>.

The course is concerned with giving students the tools to prepare for the fields and jobs of the future.<br/>
Across all university departments and majors, the numbers of students who do not work in the fields in which they’ve received their degrees is not only significant, but growing. For example, anywhere from 20-40% of STEM graduates do not work in the fields in which they received their degrees.<br/>
This does not mean that students shouldn’t major in STEM, but</span><span class="deschide"> that one of the primary purposes of higher education is learning how to learn.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Engineering Mathematics and Statistics major offered through the Engineering Science Program offers students an opportunity to study pure and applied mathematics as essential components of modern engineering. By combining courses in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics, the physical sciences, and engineering, a student may individualize a program of study, of theory, or of applications of both. It provides a broad foundation for graduate studies in theoretical branches of engineering, as well as in mathematics, and can prepare students for a career in specific sectors of industry or business.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering Science degree programs via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is competitive as there are few — if any — spaces available in this major for students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change to College of Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Engineering Mathematics and Statistics.</p>

You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement.

Across all university departments and majors, the numbers of students who do not work in the fields in which they’ve received their degrees is not only significant, but growing. For example, anywhere from 20-40% of STEM graduates do not work in the fields in which they received their degrees.<br/>
This does not mean that students shouldn’t major in STEM, but</span><span class="deschide"> that one of the primary purposes of higher education is learning how to learn.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Engineering Mathematics and Statistics major offered through the Engineering Science Program offers students an opportunity to study pure and applied mathematics as essential components of modern engineering. By combining courses in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics, the physical sciences, and engineering, a student may individualize a program of study, of theory, or of applications of both. It provides a broad foundation for graduate studies in theoretical branches of engineering, as well as in mathematics, and can prepare students for a career in specific sectors of industry or business.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering Science degree programs via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is competitive as there are few — if any — spaces available in this major for students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change to College of Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Engineering Mathematics and Statistics.</p>
