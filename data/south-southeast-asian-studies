				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The mission of the Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies is to enable students to learn about the cultures and civilizations of South and Southeast Asia. The department teaches 13 languages and is an indispensable resource for programs in many other departments and areas.</p>
<p>For undergraduate majors, the department stresses an interdisciplinary approach and expects students to specialize in one of three areas—literature, religion, or cultural history. To this end, there are two tracks for majors—one that emphasizes the study of civilization and does not require language and one that requires the students to do four semesters of language work in addition to more general studies. UC Berkeley has an extraordinary number of experts in many areas of South and Southeast Asian Studies, and students are encouraged to take advantage of relevant courses in departments such as history, music, political science, ethnic studies, art history, linguistics, gender and women’s studies, and English. Qualified undergraduates are also encouraged to participate in graduate seminars.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>There are two tracks in the South and Southeast Asian Studies major—one that emphasizes the study of civilization and does not require language, and one that requires the students to do four semesters of language work in addition to more general studies. Within each track, students specialize in an area (South or Southeast Asia).</p>
<h4>Goals for the Language Track</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Students should have mastered the grammar (included complex grammatical features) of at least one South and Southeast Asian language (Sanskrit, Hindi, Tamil, Urdu, Punjabi, Bengali, Telugu for South Asia and Indonesian, Thai, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Khmer for Southeast). They should be able to read stories, newspapers, and the like in the modern language in which they specialize.</li>
	<li>They should be able to speak and get about using the language (if relevant) and to write simple prose in the modern language.</li>
	<li>For classic languages such as Sanskrit, students should have the basic facility in reading a variety of different genres in the original, and they should be comfortable using standard resource materials such as dictionaries, traditional grammars, and online resources. They are also expected to be able to engage critically with the pertinent secondary sources relevant to the texts being read.</li>
	<li>They should have a sound knowledge of one culture or area of South or Southeast Asia.</li>
	<li>They should have a broad general acquaintance with either South or Southeast Asia including a good knowledge of cultural history, literature, and/or religion.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Goals for the Civilization Track</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Students should have a thorough understanding of the histories and culture of either South or Southeast Asia.</li>
	<li>In lieu of acquiring detailed knowledge of one of the cultural/linguistic areas of South or Southeast Asia, they are expected to deepen their mastery of cultural history or religion of South or Southeast Asia.</li>
	<li>They should specialize in a particular national tradition and/or in a particular approach to the region (historical, literary, art, performative).</li>

And how can we explain that 350 years of Dutch domination left so few traces in contemporary Indonesia?</span><br/>

This course is an advanced introduction to the major teachings of Indian Buddhism and their philosophical elaborations. We will cover the core tenets attributed to the Buddha, and the later doctrinal and scholastic developments that turned Buddhism into one of the principal philosophical traditions of India. For this we will read select primary sources—in principle, extracts of the scriptures and later treatises—and academic articles and book</span><span class="deschide"> chapters. Rather than offering a broad introductory survey of Buddhist traditions across space and time, this class is geared towards students who are already familiar with the basics of Buddhism and want to deepen their understanding of the principal teachings of Buddhism originating in India.</span><br/>

This course considers the co-option, reinterpretation and dissemination of sacred texts and religious practices in various political and cultural projects in India during the colonial and post-colonial periods. Students will be introduced to religious “reform” movements, cross-cultural debates during the colonial period, and how the concept of a secular state in post-Independence India has shaped and continues to shape religious practice and</span><span class="deschide"> public policy. Important themes include transformations in the role of women, debates around caste and “untouchability”, and religious conversions. Although the emphasis is on Hindu traditions, attention will also be given to other Indian traditions such as Islam, Christianity and Buddhism.</span><br/>

Whenever Pakistan comes up as a subject of sustained conversation in the US it usually is for all the wrong reasons: the worst nuclear proliferator in recent history, the refuge of Osama bin Laden, a major source of regional instability in South and Central Asia.

While the memorization of vocabulary and common personal exchanges practiced in 1A will make up the majority of material studied, students will have some opportunity to learn to improvise and talk about personal work and research interests in Khmer. Topics include transportation and directions,</span><span class="deschide"> the world of work, religion, health, and conducting daily life in Cambodia. Students learn to read simple authentic texts such as folk tales, personal letters, forms, and roadside signs. Students continue their study of culturally appropriate behavior in the context of Khmer culture, including notions of &quot;saving face&quot; and maintaining social harmony, and how these are expressed in both spoken language and in one's actions.</span><br/>

Non-native speakers who have completed Beginning Khmer will build spoken proficiency with emphasis on everyday &quot;storytelling&quot; and the expression of emotions, feelings, and opinions. Students will gain experience reading progressively difficult authentic Khmer texts, including folk tales and newspaper articles. Native speakers with family exposure to Khmer will be introduced to the</span><span class="deschide"> writing system. They will quickly &quot;catch up&quot; with non-native classmates who have studied the writing system before. All students will study important patterns and structures in Khmer grammar and morphology, and gain a foundation in formal spoken Khmer, express opinions and positions, form arguments, and learn to discuss a variety of topics with educated Khmer speakers. These include Khmer religion, village culture, news, and advertising.</span><br/>

Much of this study will be accomplished by working on projects in groups with other students. One such project will involve the preparation and performance of a play based</span><span class="deschide"> on sections of the modern Khmer novel students read in this course.
