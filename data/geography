				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>All human activity takes place on a geographic stage of great diversity and constant transformation. For more than a century, the Geography Department at Berkeley has been a leading center of scholarship about earth’s landscapes and human relationships to the environment. Our inquiries encompass a wide range of topics, from the economies and cultures of cities and built landscapes, to tropical climates and the flow of polar ice sheets. We combine rigorous empirical work with deeply conceptual theoretical analyses, always recognizing the importance of both spatial processes and accumulated histories. We use geographic analyses to illuminate the abiding problems of the modern world.</p>
<p>The Geography Department provides a broad-ranging perspective on humans as inhabitants and transformers of the face of the earth. The search for this kind of understanding involves thorough study of (a) the interlocking systems of the natural environment (climate, landforms, oceans, biota) and the evaluation of natural resources; (b) those diverse historical, cultural, social, economic, and political structures and processes which affect the location and spatial organization of population groups and their activities; and (c) significant geographical units, whether described as cities, regions, nations, states or landscapes, where integrated interpretation can be attempted, and a variety of problems thereby better understood.</p>
<p>As geographic theory and research has expanded their horizons over the past quarter-century, three research focuses have emerged to define geography at Berkeley: </p>
<p class="introtext"><strong><em>Earth System Science (a.k.a. Physical Geography)</em></strong></p>
<p>This branch of geography focuses on the study of the interconnected components of our environment—the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere—and how they interact to produce an integrated whole. It utilizes the fundamental disciplines of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology and applies them in the context of human activities and landscapes to understand the Earth, at scales ranging from single watersheds to the entire globe.</p>
<p>The research of our Earth Systems Science faculty epitomizes this interdisciplinary and global approach, and with expertise in biogeochemistry, biogeography, climate dynamics and climate change, geomorphology, glaciology, hydrology, and terrestrial ecology. Our research spans all corners of the world—from the swamps of the Everglades to the tundra of Alaska, from the ocean-atmosphere systems of the tropical Pacific to the vast ice sheets of Antarctica.</p>
<p class="introtext"><em><strong>Economy, Culture and Society (a.k.a. Human Geography)</strong></em></p>
<p>Human geography is a social science distinguished by its attention to the relation of humanity to the earth, in two regards. The first concerns the interaction of people with nature, including the extraction of natural resources, the environmental impact of people and their activities, and the effects of natural forces on society. The second concerns the spatial organization of societies at all scales from the local to the global (and from minutes to millennia) and the production of place, territory, and landscape by human imagination and activity.</p>
<p>Our Economy, Culture and Society faculty and graduate students work all around the world and explore an enormous range of topics: forest and range utilization in North America, urban development in China, agrarian change and resource extraction in Africa, conflict and human rights in Latin America, and much more. We examine borders and migration, conservation and development, globalization and governance while attending closely to the roles of race, gender, and class and of science, technology, and economy in shaping the world around us.</p>
<p class="introtext"><em><strong>Geospatial Representation and Analysis</strong></em></p>
<p>Advances in digital technologies have revolutionized how scholars, governments, businesses, and non-profit organizations collect, store, analyze and represent information about space, place, flows and locations. Even as the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has become ubiquitous, it has been superseded for research purposes by advances in spatial analysis, simulation modeling, remote sensing, web-based mapping, and geo-visualization. These technologies apply to the study of biophysical and social systems alike, and they are beginning to show potential to erode the practical and pedagogical obstacles that have historically separated quantitative and qualitative methods, Human and Physical Geography. Our faculty use them to model global climate and coastal sediment dynamics, gentrification, segregation, transit and public health. We encourage students to use these tools critically and creatively to answer pressing questions about the contemporary world. </p>
<h3 class="tglhead"><strong>Bachelor of Arts in Geography</strong></h3>
<p>The undergraduate major in geography is unusually broad and diverse, including the study of cultural, economic, political, historical, biophysical, urban and regional geography as well as cartography, quantitative methods, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing and fieldwork. Backgrounds in the natural and social sciences, history, and statistical methods may be useful to the geography major, with the mix and emphasis depending on the student's particular interests. Completing a major in geography requires the satisfactory completion of three lower division courses and eight upper division courses. Lower division requirements ensure that all students gain a broad understanding of the discipline, while upper division requirements are structured to allow students to specialize in the areas of their greatest interest.</p>
<p>Geography students are expected to have diverse interests and independent thought. The department welcomes students from a variety of backgrounds, including those with professional experience who wish to deepen their education. Students are encouraged to roam freely through the curriculum and to follow their inspiration where it leads while working in tandem with faculty advisers. </p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://geography.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><h3 class="tglhead"><strong>Declaring the Major</strong></h3>
<p>Students may declare the geography major after completing at least 30 units, with a 2.0 or better cumulative Berkeley GPA, and after completion of at least two of the three lower division requirements. Junior transfer students should declare their major during the beginning of their second semester at Berkeley. </p>
<p>To declare a major in geography, please schedule an appointment with the Undergraduate Major Advisor, Sarah Varner, here: <a href="https://calendly.com/svarner-geography" target="_blank">https://calendly.com/svarner-geography</a>. </p>
<p>The major requires a student to take <strong>three lower division courses</strong>, one in each of these areas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Basic Physical Geography</li>
	<li>World Geography</li>
	<li>Regional Geography</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to declare the major, a student must have taken and successfully passed at least <strong>TWO</strong> lower division courses, one from each area.<br/>

<p><br/>
Upon declaring the major and completing the three lower division course requirements, students will need to complete <strong>eight upper division courses</strong> in order to satisfy the requirements of the major. </p>
<p>All newly declared geography majors will need to choose one of the two specialty groups: <strong>Earth System Science</strong> (physical geography) or<strong> Economy, Culture and Society</strong> (human geography). <span>Please read more </span><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/geography/" target="_blank">about the geography program</a><span> for insight into the two specialty groups housed within the major. </span></p>
<p>The eight upper division courses span the two different specialty groups as well as a third section for methodology courses.</p>
<p>Both of the specialty groups have <strong>ONE</strong> required core course:</p>
<ul>
	<li>All students choosing the Earth System Science option must take <strong>Geography 140A.</strong></li>
	<li>All students choosing the Economy, Culture and Society option must take <strong>Geography 110</strong> -OR- <strong>Geography 130</strong>.</li>
	<li>Additionally, all students, regardless of their chosen specialty group, are required to take at least <strong>ONE </strong>methodology course as part of their upper division requirements.<br/>

<strong>5-2-1 Plan or 4-2-2 Plan</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, the geography department utilizes two plans by which students can complete their eight upper division requirements: the <strong>5-2-1 plan</strong> or the <strong>4-2-2 plan</strong>.</p>
<p>In both plans, the first number represents the number of courses a student must take in their chosen specialty group, while the second number represents the number of courses they must take in the other specialty group. The third number refers to the number of methodology courses a student must take.</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of each plan:</p>
<p><strong>5-2-1 Plan</strong></p>
<p>A total of 8 upper division courses, with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>5 courses from your chosen specialty group</li>
	<li>2 courses from the other specialty group</li>
	<li>1 methodology course</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4-2-2 Plan</strong></p>
<p>A total of 8 upper division courses, with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>4 courses from your chosen specialty group</li>
	<li>2 courses from the other specialty group</li>
	<li>2 methodology courses</li>
</ul>
<p>The 5-2-1 and 4-2-2 plans are not set in stone and can be changed easily during the progression of the major. Please consult with the UMA if you have questions about changing your plan.</p>
<h3 class="tglhead"><strong>Academic Performance Requirements</strong></h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only.</li>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students are welcome to declare a minor in geography to complement their academic study in another department. The minor will be noted officially on a student's transcript in the memoranda section, but will not be included on the official diploma.</p>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>The geography minor is comprised of any five upper division courses, as long as one course is selected from each specialty group (physical geography and human geography).</li>
	<li>All five upper division courses counting toward the minor must be taken for a letter grade.</li>
	<li>At least three of the five courses must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor.</li>

The goals of this introductory Earth System Science course are to achieve a scientific understanding of important problems in global environmental change and to learn how to analyze a complex system using scientific methods. Earth System Science is an interdisciplinary field that describes the cycling of energy and matter between the different spheres (atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, and lithosphere) of the earth system. Under</span><span class="deschide"> the overarching themes of human-induced climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and biodiversity loss, we will explore key concepts of solar radiation, plate tectonics, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and the history of life on Earth.</span><br/>

Postcolonial studies focus on how processes of colonialism/imperialism continue even after the formal dissolution of empire. A central argument of this course is that critical human geography can make important contributions to understanding the interconnections between forces at play in different parts of the world. Drawing on concepts of space, place, culture, power, and difference, its purpose is to provide a set of tools for grappling with</span><span class="deschide"> the conditions in which we find ourselves, and for thinking about the possibilities for social change.</span><br/>

This course explores historical, cultural, and socio-economic geographies of cities, city life, and the organization of metropolitan political power. It is primarily focused on the U.S., but will draw on select examples from abroad. We will investigate urbanization as a general process and the resulting physical, social, cultural, and political economic forms of cities and examine the ways that cities have addressed tensions emerging from segregation and urban renewal.</span><span class="deschide"> We will also look at both the ways in which social inequality is reinforced through the politics, policies, and design of the built environment as well as strategies for fostering and nurturing inclusive and equitable urban spaces through city design and policy.</span><br/>

The American city, palimpsest of a nation. It all comes together in the modern metropolis: economy, society, politics, culture, and geography. Cities as the economic engines of capitalism, centers of industry, finance, business, consumption, and innovation.

Cities as magnificent constructs, built of concrete, credit and land rents</span><span class="deschide">, from skyscrapers to housing tracts, freeways to shopping malls, airports to open spaces.

How does the chemical makeup of Earth make it suitable for life? And how does life in turn alter the chemistry of our planet? Biogeochemistry is the field of science that explores the imprint of biota (including humans) on the chemistry of the ocean, land and atmosphere. This interdisciplinary field addresses global problems, including climate change feedbacks, air quality, land use change, and marine ecosystem health. We will provide an overview</span><span class="deschide"> of the major biogeochemical cycles, discuss the biogeochemistry of major ecosystems, and introduce the major biogeochemical questions being asked today. We also cover measurement techniques, including hands-on activities to introduce students to experimental methods and data analysis.</span><br/>

Through class discussions and homework assignments students will learn of historic climate catastrophes, how different societies have responded and what we can learn from these responses in terms of building climate resilience. We will go through simplified physical processes associated with recent climate events and delve into the details of how they occur and to what extent climate extremes are trending. One of the important learning objectives is to provide dual learning, that is, I propose to offer upper level undergraduates that lack sufficient mathematics and physics, while at the same provide graduate students and atmospheric science/statistics undergraduates a detailed understanding of climate impacts and risks. Graduate students have an augmented set of homework problems.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> An expected learning outcome is the ability to articulate climate risk with clear descriptions of mechanisms of change, degree and likelihood of impacts and methods of risk reduction. This class and Climates of the World will essentially be a two-semester sequence that (1) introduces students to the basic concepts of meteorology, climate change, climate extremes and (2) the types of risks and strategies that are currently being implemented and are in planning stages.</p></div>

This course introduces ways of seeing, describing, interpreting, and speculating on how everyday American built environments have given shape and meaning to social life. To that end, it surveys transformations in the country’s vernacular urban, suburban, and (to some extent) rural landscapes, at several scales: houses, yards, storefronts, parks, street patterns, workplaces, transit infrastructures, billboards, gas stations, and more. Addressed at one</span><span class="deschide"> level to landscape as material culture, the course also assembles an eclectic intellectual history of lay and official attempts to study, define, critique, make sense of, represent, and intervene on ordinary Americans and their space. Readings include primary as well as secondary sources.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>All human activity takes place on a geographic stage of great diversity and constant transformation. For more than a century, the Geography Department at Berkeley has been a leading center of scholarship about earth’s landscapes and human relationships to the environment. Our inquiries encompass a wide range of topics, from the economies and cultures of cities and built landscapes, to tropical climates and the flow of polar ice sheets. We combine rigorous empirical work with deeply conceptual theoretical analyses, always recognizing the importance of both spatial processes and accumulated histories. We use geographic analyses to illuminate the abiding problems of the modern world.</p>
<p>The Geography Department provides a broad-ranging perspective on humans as inhabitants and transformers of the face of the earth. The search for this kind of understanding involves thorough study of (a) the interlocking systems of the natural environment (climate, landforms, oceans, biota) and the evaluation of natural resources; (b) those diverse historical, cultural, social, economic, and political structures and processes which affect the location and spatial organization of population groups and their activities; and (c) significant geographical units, whether described as cities, regions, nations, states or landscapes, where integrated interpretation can be attempted, and a variety of problems thereby better understood.</p>
<p>As geographic theory and research has expanded their horizons over the past quarter-century, three research focuses have emerged to define geography at Berkeley: </p>
<p class="introtext"><strong><em>Earth System Science (a.k.a. Physical Geography)</em></strong></p>
<p>This branch of geography focuses on the study of the interconnected components of our environment—the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere—and how they interact to produce an integrated whole. It utilizes the fundamental disciplines of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology and applies them in the context of human activities and landscapes to understand the Earth, at scales ranging from single watersheds to the entire globe.</p>
<p>The research of our Earth Systems Science faculty epitomizes this interdisciplinary and global approach, and with expertise in biogeochemistry, biogeography, climate dynamics and climate change, geomorphology, glaciology, hydrology, and terrestrial ecology. Our research spans all corners of the world—from the swamps of the Everglades to the tundra of Alaska, from the ocean-atmosphere systems of the tropical Pacific to the vast ice sheets of Antarctica.</p>
<p class="introtext"><em><strong>Economy, Culture and Society (a.k.a. Human Geography)</strong></em></p>
<p>Human geography is a social science distinguished by its attention to the relation of humanity to the earth, in two regards. The first concerns the interaction of people with nature, including the extraction of natural resources, the environmental impact of people and their activities, and the effects of natural forces on society. The second concerns the spatial organization of societies at all scales from the local to the global (and from minutes to millennia) and the production of place, territory, and landscape by human imagination and activity.</p>
<p>Our Economy, Culture and Society faculty and graduate students work all around the world and explore an enormous range of topics: forest and range utilization in North America, urban development in China, agrarian change and resource extraction in Africa, conflict and human rights in Latin America, and much more. We examine borders and migration, conservation and development, globalization and governance while attending closely to the roles of race, gender, and class and of science, technology, and economy in shaping the world around us.</p>
<p class="introtext"><em><strong>Geospatial Representation and Analysis</strong></em></p>
<p>Advances in digital technologies have revolutionized how scholars, governments, businesses, and non-profit organizations collect, store, analyze and represent information about space, place, flows and locations. Even as the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has become ubiquitous, it has been superseded for research purposes by advances in spatial analysis, simulation modeling, remote sensing, web-based mapping, and geo-visualization. These technologies apply to the study of biophysical and social systems alike, and they are beginning to show potential to erode the practical and pedagogical obstacles that have historically separated quantitative and qualitative methods, Human and Physical Geography. Our faculty use them to model global climate and coastal sediment dynamics, gentrification, segregation, transit and public health. We encourage students to use these tools critically and creatively to answer pressing questions about the contemporary world. </p>
<h3 class="tglhead"><strong>Bachelor of Arts in Geography</strong></h3>
<p>The undergraduate major in geography is unusually broad and diverse, including the study of cultural, economic, political, historical, biophysical, urban and regional geography as well as cartography, quantitative methods, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing and fieldwork. Backgrounds in the natural and social sciences, history, and statistical methods may be useful to the geography major, with the mix and emphasis depending on the student's particular interests. Completing a major in geography requires the satisfactory completion of three lower division courses and eight upper division courses. Lower division requirements ensure that all students gain a broad understanding of the discipline, while upper division requirements are structured to allow students to specialize in the areas of their greatest interest.</p>
<p>Geography students are expected to have diverse interests and independent thought. The department welcomes students from a variety of backgrounds, including those with professional experience who wish to deepen their education. Students are encouraged to roam freely through the curriculum and to follow their inspiration where it leads while working in tandem with faculty advisers. </p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://geography.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><h3 class="tglhead"><strong>Declaring the Major</strong></h3>
<p>Students may declare the geography major after completing at least 30 units, with a 2.0 or better cumulative Berkeley GPA, and after completion of at least two of the three lower division requirements. Junior transfer students should declare their major during the beginning of their second semester at Berkeley. </p>
<p>To declare a major in geography, please schedule an appointment with the Undergraduate Major Advisor, Sarah Varner, here: <a href="https://calendly.com/svarner-geography" target="_blank">https://calendly.com/svarner-geography</a>. </p>
<p>The major requires a student to take <strong>three lower division courses</strong>, one in each of these areas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Basic Physical Geography</li>
	<li>World Geography</li>
	<li>Regional Geography</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to declare the major, a student must have taken and successfully passed at least <strong>TWO</strong> lower division courses, one from each area.<br/>

<p><br/>
Upon declaring the major and completing the three lower division course requirements, students will need to complete <strong>eight upper division courses</strong> in order to satisfy the requirements of the major. </p>
<p>All newly declared geography majors will need to choose one of the two specialty groups: <strong>Earth System Science</strong> (physical geography) or<strong> Economy, Culture and Society</strong> (human geography). <span>Please read more </span><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/geography/" target="_blank">about the geography program</a><span> for insight into the two specialty groups housed within the major. </span></p>
<p>The eight upper division courses span the two different specialty groups as well as a third section for methodology courses.</p>
<p>Both of the specialty groups have <strong>ONE</strong> required core course:</p>
<ul>
	<li>All students choosing the Earth System Science option must take <strong>Geography 140A.</strong></li>
	<li>All students choosing the Economy, Culture and Society option must take <strong>Geography 110</strong> -OR- <strong>Geography 130</strong>.</li>
	<li>Additionally, all students, regardless of their chosen specialty group, are required to take at least <strong>ONE </strong>methodology course as part of their upper division requirements.<br/>

<strong>5-2-1 Plan or 4-2-2 Plan</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, the geography department utilizes two plans by which students can complete their eight upper division requirements: the <strong>5-2-1 plan</strong> or the <strong>4-2-2 plan</strong>.</p>
<p>In both plans, the first number represents the number of courses a student must take in their chosen specialty group, while the second number represents the number of courses they must take in the other specialty group. The third number refers to the number of methodology courses a student must take.</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of each plan:</p>
<p><strong>5-2-1 Plan</strong></p>
<p>A total of 8 upper division courses, with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>5 courses from your chosen specialty group</li>
	<li>2 courses from the other specialty group</li>
	<li>1 methodology course</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4-2-2 Plan</strong></p>
<p>A total of 8 upper division courses, with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>4 courses from your chosen specialty group</li>
	<li>2 courses from the other specialty group</li>
	<li>2 methodology courses</li>
</ul>
<p>The 5-2-1 and 4-2-2 plans are not set in stone and can be changed easily during the progression of the major. Please consult with the UMA if you have questions about changing your plan.</p>
<h3 class="tglhead"><strong>Academic Performance Requirements</strong></h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only.</li>
	<li>GEOG H195A/H195B, GEOG 197, GEOG 198, and GEOG 199 cannot be used to satisfy a major or minor program requirement.</li>
	<li>All students must complete at least one semester of residence in the major before graduation.</li>
	<li>Students are expected to enroll in at least 13 units per semester, with 15 units being considered a normal course load. The maximum number of units allowed per semester is 20.5; for unique situations, exceptions can be granted to exceed the maximum. Please meet with the UMA to discuss your request to exceed the semester unit cap.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average of a 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>
	<li>Students must learn at least a C- in all courses required for the major, including lower and upper division courses.</li>
</ol>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students are welcome to declare a minor in geography to complement their academic study in another department. The minor will be noted officially on a student's transcript in the memoranda section, but will not be included on the official diploma.</p>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>The geography minor is comprised of any five upper division courses, as long as one course is selected from each specialty group (physical geography and human geography).</li>
	<li>All five upper division courses counting toward the minor must be taken for a letter grade.</li>
	<li>At least three of the five courses must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Students interested in the geography minor should schedule a meeting with the UMA in order to declare the minor.</p>

California may be &quot;a state of mind,&quot; but it is also the most dynamic place in the most powerful country in the world, and would be the 8th largest economy if it were a country. Its</span><span class="deschide"> wealth has been built on mining, agriculture, industry, trade, and finance. Natural abundance and geographic advantage have played their parts, but the state's greatest resource has been its wealth and diversity of people, who have made it a center of technological and cultural innovation from Hollywood to Silicon Valley. Yet California has a dark side of exploitation and racialization.</span><br/>

Postcolonial studies focus on how processes of colonialism/imperialism continue even after the formal dissolution of empire. A central argument of this course is that critical human geography can make important contributions to understanding the interconnections between forces at play in different parts of the world.

We read the oceanic novel Moby Dick and think across themes including the geography of the Mediterranean, the riotous Atlantic, the imperial Pacific, the anticolonial Caribbean and the Muslim Indian Ocean; and we look at ports, containers, oceanic infrastructure and precarious marine livelihoods today. We read thinkers from our oceanic planet to imagine</span><span class="deschide"> an oceanic way of thinking.</span><br/>

How does the chemical makeup of Earth make it suitable for life? And how does life in turn alter the chemistry of our planet? Biogeochemistry is the field of science that explores the imprint of biota (including humans) on the chemistry of the ocean, land and atmosphere. This interdisciplinary field addresses global problems, including climate change feedbacks, air quality, land use change, and marine ecosystem health. We will provide an overview</span><span class="deschide"> of the major biogeochemical cycles, discuss the biogeochemistry of major ecosystems, and introduce the major biogeochemical questions being asked today. We also cover measurement techniques, including hands-on activities to introduce students to experimental methods and data analysis.</span><br/>

Through class discussions and homework assignments students will learn of historic climate catastrophes, how different societies have responded and what we can learn from these responses in terms of building climate resilience. We will go through simplified physical processes associated with recent climate events and delve into the details of how they occur and to what extent climate extremes are trending. One of the important learning objectives is to provide dual learning, that is, I propose to offer upper level undergraduates that lack sufficient mathematics and physics, while at the same provide graduate students and atmospheric science/statistics undergraduates a detailed understanding of climate impacts and risks. Graduate students have an augmented set of homework problems.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> An expected learning outcome is the ability to articulate climate risk with clear descriptions of mechanisms of change, degree and likelihood of impacts and methods of risk reduction. This class and Climates of the World will essentially be a two-semester sequence that (1) introduces students to the basic concepts of meteorology, climate change, climate extremes and (2) the types of risks and strategies that are currently being implemented and are in planning stages.</p></div>

To that end, it surveys transformations in the country’s vernacular urban, suburban, and (to some extent) rural landscapes, at several scales: houses, yards, storefronts, parks, street patterns, workplaces, transit infrastructures, billboards, gas stations, and more. Addressed at one</span><span class="deschide"> level to landscape as material culture, the course also assembles an eclectic intellectual history of lay and official attempts to study, define, critique, make sense of, represent, and intervene on ordinary Americans and their space.

A spatial analytic approach to digital mapping and GIS. Given that recording the geolocation of scientific, business and social data is now routine, the question of what we can learn from the spatial aspect of data arises. This class looks at challenges in analyzing spatial data, particularly scale and spatial dependence. Various methods are considered such as hotspot detection, interpolation, and map overlay. The emphasis throughout is hands</span><span class="deschide"> on and practical rather than theoretical.<br/></span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>All human activity takes place on a geographic stage of great diversity and constant transformation. For more than a century, the Geography Department at Berkeley has been a leading center of scholarship about earth’s landscapes and human relationships to the environment. Our inquiries encompass a wide range of topics, from the economies and cultures of cities and built landscapes, to tropical climates and the flow of polar ice sheets. We combine rigorous empirical work with deeply conceptual theoretical analyses, always recognizing the importance of both spatial processes and accumulated histories. We use geographic analyses to illuminate the abiding problems of the modern world.</p>
<p>The Geography Department provides a broad-ranging perspective on humans as inhabitants and transformers of the face of the earth. The search for this kind of understanding involves thorough study of (a) the interlocking systems of the natural environment (climate, landforms, oceans, biota) and the evaluation of natural resources; (b) those diverse historical, cultural, social, economic, and political structures and processes which affect the location and spatial organization of population groups and their activities; and (c) significant geographical units, whether described as cities, regions, nations, states or landscapes, where integrated interpretation can be attempted, and a variety of problems thereby better understood.</p>
<p>As geographic theory and research has expanded their horizons over the past quarter-century, three research focuses have emerged to define geography at Berkeley: </p>
<p class="introtext"><strong><em>Earth System Science (a.k.a. Physical Geography)</em></strong></p>
<p>This branch of geography focuses on the study of the interconnected components of our environment—the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere—and how they interact to produce an integrated whole. It utilizes the fundamental disciplines of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology and applies them in the context of human activities and landscapes to understand the Earth, at scales ranging from single watersheds to the entire globe.</p>
<p>The research of our Earth Systems Science faculty epitomizes this interdisciplinary and global approach, and with expertise in biogeochemistry, biogeography, climate dynamics and climate change, geomorphology, glaciology, hydrology, and terrestrial ecology. Our research spans all corners of the world—from the swamps of the Everglades to the tundra of Alaska, from the ocean-atmosphere systems of the tropical Pacific to the vast ice sheets of Antarctica.</p>
<p class="introtext"><em><strong>Economy, Culture and Society (a.k.a. Human Geography)</strong></em></p>
<p>Human geography is a social science distinguished by its attention to the relation of humanity to the earth, in two regards. The first concerns the interaction of people with nature, including the extraction of natural resources, the environmental impact of people and their activities, and the effects of natural forces on society. The second concerns the spatial organization of societies at all scales from the local to the global (and from minutes to millennia) and the production of place, territory, and landscape by human imagination and activity.</p>
<p>Our Economy, Culture and Society faculty and graduate students work all around the world and explore an enormous range of topics: forest and range utilization in North America, urban development in China, agrarian change and resource extraction in Africa, conflict and human rights in Latin America, and much more. We examine borders and migration, conservation and development, globalization and governance while attending closely to the roles of race, gender, and class and of science, technology, and economy in shaping the world around us.</p>
<p class="introtext"><em><strong>Geospatial Representation and Analysis</strong></em></p>
<p>Advances in digital technologies have revolutionized how scholars, governments, businesses, and non-profit organizations collect, store, analyze and represent information about space, place, flows and locations. Even as the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has become ubiquitous, it has been superseded for research purposes by advances in spatial analysis, simulation modeling, remote sensing, web-based mapping, and geo-visualization. These technologies apply to the study of biophysical and social systems alike, and they are beginning to show potential to erode the practical and pedagogical obstacles that have historically separated quantitative and qualitative methods, Human and Physical Geography. Our faculty use them to model global climate and coastal sediment dynamics, gentrification, segregation, transit and public health. We encourage students to use these tools critically and creatively to answer pressing questions about the contemporary world. </p>
<h3 class="tglhead"><strong>Bachelor of Arts in Geography</strong></h3>
<p>The undergraduate major in geography is unusually broad and diverse, including the study of cultural, economic, political, historical, biophysical, urban and regional geography as well as cartography, quantitative methods, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing and fieldwork. Backgrounds in the natural and social sciences, history, and statistical methods may be useful to the geography major, with the mix and emphasis depending on the student's particular interests. Completing a major in geography requires the satisfactory completion of three lower division courses and eight upper division courses. Lower division requirements ensure that all students gain a broad understanding of the discipline, while upper division requirements are structured to allow students to specialize in the areas of their greatest interest.</p>
<p>Geography students are expected to have diverse interests and independent thought. The department welcomes students from a variety of backgrounds, including those with professional experience who wish to deepen their education. Students are encouraged to roam freely through the curriculum and to follow their inspiration where it leads while working in tandem with faculty advisers. </p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://geography.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><h3 class="tglhead"><strong>Declaring the Major</strong></h3>
<p>Students may declare the geography major after completing at least 30 units, with a 2.0 or better cumulative Berkeley GPA, and after completion of at least two of the three lower division requirements. Junior transfer students should declare their major during the beginning of their second semester at Berkeley. </p>
<p>To declare a major in geography, please schedule an appointment with the Undergraduate Major Advisor, Sarah Varner, here: <a href="https://calendly.com/svarner-geography" target="_blank">https://calendly.com/svarner-geography</a>. </p>
<p>The major requires a student to take <strong>three lower division courses</strong>, one in each of these areas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Basic Physical Geography</li>
	<li>World Geography</li>
	<li>Regional Geography</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to declare the major, a student must have taken and successfully passed at least <strong>TWO</strong> lower division courses, one from each area.<br/>

Upon declaring the major and completing the three lower division course requirements, students will need to complete <strong>eight upper division courses</strong> in order to satisfy the requirements of the major. </p>
<p>All newly declared geography majors will need to choose one of the two specialty groups: <strong>Earth System Science</strong> (physical geography) or<strong> Economy, Culture and Society</strong> (human geography). <span>Please read more </span><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/geography/" target="_blank">about the geography program</a><span> for insight into the two specialty groups housed within the major. </span></p>
<p>The eight upper division courses span the two different specialty groups as well as a third section for methodology courses.</p>
<p>Both of the specialty groups have <strong>ONE</strong> required core course:</p>
<ul>
	<li>All students choosing the Earth System Science option must take <strong>Geography 140A.</strong></li>
	<li>All students choosing the Economy, Culture and Society option must take <strong>Geography 110</strong> -OR- <strong>Geography 130</strong>.</li>
	<li>Additionally, all students, regardless of their chosen specialty group, are required to take at least <strong>ONE </strong>methodology course as part of their upper division requirements.<br/>

<strong>5-2-1 Plan or 4-2-2 Plan</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, the geography department utilizes two plans by which students can complete their eight upper division requirements: the <strong>5-2-1 plan</strong> or the <strong>4-2-2 plan</strong>.</p>
<p>In both plans, the first number represents the number of courses a student must take in their chosen specialty group, while the second number represents the number of courses they must take in the other specialty group. The third number refers to the number of methodology courses a student must take.</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of each plan:</p>
<p><strong>5-2-1 Plan</strong></p>
<p>A total of 8 upper division courses, with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>5 courses from your chosen specialty group</li>
	<li>2 courses from the other specialty group</li>
	<li>1 methodology course</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4-2-2 Plan</strong></p>
<p>A total of 8 upper division courses, with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>4 courses from your chosen specialty group</li>
	<li>2 courses from the other specialty group</li>
	<li>2 methodology courses</li>
</ul>
<p>The 5-2-1 and 4-2-2 plans are not set in stone and can be changed easily during the progression of the major. Please consult with the UMA if you have questions about changing your plan.</p>
<h3 class="tglhead"><strong>Academic Performance Requirements</strong></h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only.</li>
	<li>GEOG H195A/H195B, GEOG 197, GEOG 198, and GEOG 199 cannot be used to satisfy a major or minor program requirement.</li>
	<li>All students must complete at least one semester of residence in the major before graduation.</li>
	<li>Students are expected to enroll in at least 13 units per semester, with 15 units being considered a normal course load. The maximum number of units allowed per semester is 20.5; for unique situations, exceptions can be granted to exceed the maximum. Please meet with the UMA to discuss your request to exceed the semester unit cap.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average of a 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>
	<li>Students must learn at least a C- in all courses required for the major, including lower and upper division courses.</li>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students are welcome to declare a minor in geography to complement their academic study in another department. The minor will be noted officially on a student's transcript in the memoranda section, but will not be included on the official diploma.</p>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>The geography minor is comprised of any five upper division courses, as long as one course is selected from each specialty group (physical geography and human geography).</li>
	<li>All five upper division courses counting toward the minor must be taken for a letter grade.</li>
	<li>At least three of the five courses must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate.</li>

Postcolonial studies focus on how processes of colonialism/imperialism continue even after the formal dissolution of empire. A central argument of this course is that critical human geography can make important contributions to understanding the interconnections between forces at play in different parts of the world. Drawing on concepts of space, place, culture, power, and difference, its purpose is to provide a set of tools for grappling with</span><span class="deschide"> the conditions in which we find ourselves, and for thinking about the possibilities for social change.</span><br/>

How does the chemical makeup of Earth make it suitable for life? And how does life in turn alter the chemistry of our planet? Biogeochemistry is the field of science that explores the imprint of biota (including humans) on the chemistry of the ocean, land and atmosphere. This interdisciplinary field addresses global problems, including climate change feedbacks, air quality, land use change, and marine ecosystem health. We will provide an overview</span><span class="deschide"> of the major biogeochemical cycles, discuss the biogeochemistry of major ecosystems, and introduce the major biogeochemical questions being asked today. We also cover measurement techniques, including hands-on activities to introduce students to experimental methods and data analysis.</span><br/>

This course provides a very basic description of atmospheric physics and dynamics at the large scale, followed by region-specific climate systems and response. We examine the inter-relationships between the role of climate variations and change to impacts, risk and adaptation. Each week's reading will be integrated into class participation with examples from recent weather events. Class begins with a brief weather review that focuses on a specific geographic region</span><span class="deschide">, followed by the topic of the day, a break, and class discussion of weather events and impacts related to the topic. There will be four homework sets, four quizzes, a mid-term and final exam.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The objective is to provide an understanding of climate attribution, risk probabilities and socio-economic and ecological impacts of climate change and strategies of risk reduction. Through class discussions and homework assignments students will learn of historic climate catastrophes, how different societies have responded and what we can learn from these responses in terms of building climate resilience. We will go through simplified physical processes associated with recent climate events and delve into the details of how they occur and to what extent climate extremes are trending. One of the important learning objectives is to provide dual learning, that is, I propose to offer upper level undergraduates that lack sufficient mathematics and physics, while at the same provide graduate students and atmospheric science/statistics undergraduates a detailed understanding of climate impacts and risks. Graduate students have an augmented set of homework problems.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> An expected learning outcome is the ability to articulate climate risk with clear descriptions of mechanisms of change, degree and likelihood of impacts and methods of risk reduction. This class and Climates of the World will essentially be a two-semester sequence that (1) introduces students to the basic concepts of meteorology, climate change, climate extremes and (2) the types of risks and strategies that are currently being implemented and are in planning stages.</p></div>

This course introduces ways of seeing, describing, interpreting, and speculating on how everyday American built environments have given shape and meaning to social life. To that end, it surveys transformations in the country’s vernacular urban, suburban, and (to some extent) rural landscapes, at several scales: houses, yards, storefronts, parks, street patterns, workplaces, transit infrastructures, billboards, gas stations, and more. Addressed at one</span><span class="deschide"> level to landscape as material culture, the course also assembles an eclectic intellectual history of lay and official attempts to study, define, critique, make sense of, represent, and intervene on ordinary Americans and their space. Readings include primary as well as secondary sources.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>All human activity takes place on a geographic stage of great diversity and constant transformation. For more than a century, the Geography Department at Berkeley has been a leading center of scholarship about earth’s landscapes and human relationships to the environment. Our inquiries encompass a wide range of topics, from the economies and cultures of cities and built landscapes, to tropical climates and the flow of polar ice sheets. We combine rigorous empirical work with deeply conceptual theoretical analyses, always recognizing the importance of both spatial processes and accumulated histories. We use geographic analyses to illuminate the abiding problems of the modern world.</p>
<p>The Geography Department provides a broad-ranging perspective on humans as inhabitants and transformers of the face of the earth. The search for this kind of understanding involves thorough study of (a) the interlocking systems of the natural environment (climate, landforms, oceans, biota) and the evaluation of natural resources; (b) those diverse historical, cultural, social, economic, and political structures and processes which affect the location and spatial organization of population groups and their activities; and (c) significant geographical units, whether described as cities, regions, nations, states or landscapes, where integrated interpretation can be attempted, and a variety of problems thereby better understood.</p>
<p>As geographic theory and research has expanded their horizons over the past quarter-century, three research focuses have emerged to define geography at Berkeley: </p>
<p class="introtext"><strong><em>Earth System Science (a.k.a. Physical Geography)</em></strong></p>
<p>This branch of geography focuses on the study of the interconnected components of our environment—the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere—and how they interact to produce an integrated whole. It utilizes the fundamental disciplines of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology and applies them in the context of human activities and landscapes to understand the Earth, at scales ranging from single watersheds to the entire globe.</p>
<p>The research of our Earth Systems Science faculty epitomizes this interdisciplinary and global approach, and with expertise in biogeochemistry, biogeography, climate dynamics and climate change, geomorphology, glaciology, hydrology, and terrestrial ecology. Our research spans all corners of the world—from the swamps of the Everglades to the tundra of Alaska, from the ocean-atmosphere systems of the tropical Pacific to the vast ice sheets of Antarctica.</p>
<p class="introtext"><em><strong>Economy, Culture and Society (a.k.a. Human Geography)</strong></em></p>
<p>Human geography is a social science distinguished by its attention to the relation of humanity to the earth, in two regards. The first concerns the interaction of people with nature, including the extraction of natural resources, the environmental impact of people and their activities, and the effects of natural forces on society. The second concerns the spatial organization of societies at all scales from the local to the global (and from minutes to millennia) and the production of place, territory, and landscape by human imagination and activity.</p>
<p>Our Economy, Culture and Society faculty and graduate students work all around the world and explore an enormous range of topics: forest and range utilization in North America, urban development in China, agrarian change and resource extraction in Africa, conflict and human rights in Latin America, and much more. We examine borders and migration, conservation and development, globalization and governance while attending closely to the roles of race, gender, and class and of science, technology, and economy in shaping the world around us.</p>
<p class="introtext"><em><strong>Geospatial Representation and Analysis</strong></em></p>
<p>Advances in digital technologies have revolutionized how scholars, governments, businesses, and non-profit organizations collect, store, analyze and represent information about space, place, flows and locations. Even as the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has become ubiquitous, it has been superseded for research purposes by advances in spatial analysis, simulation modeling, remote sensing, web-based mapping, and geo-visualization. These technologies apply to the study of biophysical and social systems alike, and they are beginning to show potential to erode the practical and pedagogical obstacles that have historically separated quantitative and qualitative methods, Human and Physical Geography. Our faculty use them to model global climate and coastal sediment dynamics, gentrification, segregation, transit and public health. We encourage students to use these tools critically and creatively to answer pressing questions about the contemporary world. </p>
<h3 class="tglhead"><strong>Bachelor of Arts in Geography</strong></h3>
<p>The undergraduate major in geography is unusually broad and diverse, including the study of cultural, economic, political, historical, biophysical, urban and regional geography as well as cartography, quantitative methods, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing and fieldwork. Backgrounds in the natural and social sciences, history, and statistical methods may be useful to the geography major, with the mix and emphasis depending on the student's particular interests. Completing a major in geography requires the satisfactory completion of three lower division courses and eight upper division courses. Lower division requirements ensure that all students gain a broad understanding of the discipline, while upper division requirements are structured to allow students to specialize in the areas of their greatest interest.</p>
<p>Geography students are expected to have diverse interests and independent thought. The department welcomes students from a variety of backgrounds, including those with professional experience who wish to deepen their education. Students are encouraged to roam freely through the curriculum and to follow their inspiration where it leads while working in tandem with faculty advisers. </p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://geography.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><h3 class="tglhead"><strong>Declaring the Major</strong></h3>
<p>Students may declare the geography major after completing at least 30 units, with a 2.0 or better cumulative Berkeley GPA, and after completion of at least two of the three lower division requirements. Junior transfer students should declare their major during the beginning of their second semester at Berkeley. </p>
<p>To declare a major in geography, please schedule an appointment with the Undergraduate Major Advisor, Sarah Varner, here: <a href="https://calendly.com/svarner-geography" target="_blank">https://calendly.com/svarner-geography</a>. </p>
<p>The major requires a student to take <strong>three lower division courses</strong>, one in each of these areas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Basic Physical Geography</li>
	<li>World Geography</li>
	<li>Regional Geography</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to declare the major, a student must have taken and successfully passed at least <strong>TWO</strong> lower division courses, one from each area.<br/>

Upon declaring the major and completing the three lower division course requirements, students will need to complete <strong>eight upper division courses</strong> in order to satisfy the requirements of the major. </p>
<p>All newly declared geography majors will need to choose one of the two specialty groups: <strong>Earth System Science</strong> (physical geography) or<strong> Economy, Culture and Society</strong> (human geography). <span>Please read more </span><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/geography/" target="_blank">about the geography program</a><span> for insight into the two specialty groups housed within the major. </span></p>
<p>The eight upper division courses span the two different specialty groups as well as a third section for methodology courses.</p>
<p>Both of the specialty groups have <strong>ONE</strong> required core course:</p>
<ul>
	<li>All students choosing the Earth System Science option must take <strong>Geography 140A.</strong></li>
	<li>All students choosing the Economy, Culture and Society option must take <strong>Geography 110</strong> -OR- <strong>Geography 130</strong>.</li>
	<li>Additionally, all students, regardless of their chosen specialty group, are required to take at least <strong>ONE </strong>methodology course as part of their upper division requirements.<br/>

<strong>5-2-1 Plan or 4-2-2 Plan</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, the geography department utilizes two plans by which students can complete their eight upper division requirements: the <strong>5-2-1 plan</strong> or the <strong>4-2-2 plan</strong>.</p>
<p>In both plans, the first number represents the number of courses a student must take in their chosen specialty group, while the second number represents the number of courses they must take in the other specialty group. The third number refers to the number of methodology courses a student must take.</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of each plan:</p>
<p><strong>5-2-1 Plan</strong></p>
<p>A total of 8 upper division courses, with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>5 courses from your chosen specialty group</li>
	<li>2 courses from the other specialty group</li>
	<li>1 methodology course</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4-2-2 Plan</strong></p>
<p>A total of 8 upper division courses, with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>4 courses from your chosen specialty group</li>
	<li>2 courses from the other specialty group</li>
	<li>2 methodology courses</li>
</ul>
<p>The 5-2-1 and 4-2-2 plans are not set in stone and can be changed easily during the progression of the major. Please consult with the UMA if you have questions about changing your plan.</p>
<h3 class="tglhead"><strong>Academic Performance Requirements</strong></h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only.</li>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students are welcome to declare a minor in geography to complement their academic study in another department. The minor will be noted officially on a student's transcript in the memoranda section, but will not be included on the official diploma.</p>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>The geography minor is comprised of any five upper division courses, as long as one course is selected from each specialty group (physical geography and human geography).</li>
	<li>All five upper division courses counting toward the minor must be taken for a letter grade.</li>
	<li>At least three of the five courses must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Students interested in the geography minor should schedule a meeting with the UMA in order to declare the minor.</p>
<ul>
	<li>All undergraduate minors must be declared <strong>no later than one semester prior to a student’s Expected Graduation Term (EGT)</strong>. The deadline is the last day of RRR Week during that term.</li>

The goals of this introductory Earth System Science course are to achieve a scientific understanding of important problems in global environmental change and to learn how to analyze a complex system using scientific methods. Earth System Science is an interdisciplinary field that describes the cycling of energy and matter between the different spheres (atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, and lithosphere) of the earth system. Under</span><span class="deschide"> the overarching themes of human-induced climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and biodiversity loss, we will explore key concepts of solar radiation, plate tectonics, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and the history of life on Earth.</span><br/>

This course examines whether the convergence between the ‘new Right’ and the ‘new Left’ has successfully addressed the central challenge of contemporary global development studies. It asks students to assess the multiple, nonlinear, and interconnected paths of change in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East that are now taking place. It explores the context of intensified global integration and capitalist development. Students</span><span class="deschide"> will consider what changes in this context mean for larger social change, especially given ongoing global economic crises and rapidly evolving relations.</span><br/>

Postcolonial studies focus on how processes of colonialism/imperialism continue even after the formal dissolution of empire. A central argument of this course is that critical human geography can make important contributions to understanding the interconnections between forces at play in different parts of the world.

This course explores historical, cultural, and socio-economic geographies of cities, city life, and the organization of metropolitan political power. It is primarily focused on the U.S., but will draw on select examples from abroad. We will investigate urbanization as a general process and the resulting physical, social, cultural, and political economic forms of cities and examine the ways that cities have addressed tensions emerging from segregation and urban renewal.</span><span class="deschide"> We will also look at both the ways in which social inequality is reinforced through the politics, policies, and design of the built environment as well as strategies for fostering and nurturing inclusive and equitable urban spaces through city design and policy.</span><br/>

This course examines the processes that determine the structure and circulation of the Earth's atmosphere. The approach is deductive rather than descriptive: to figure out the properties and behavior of the Earth's atmosphere based on the laws of physics and fluid dynamics. Topics will include interaction between radiation and atmospheric composition; the role of water in the energy and radiation balance; governing equations for atmospheric motion</span><span class="deschide">, mass conservation, and thermodynamic energy balance; geostrophic flow, quasigeostrophic motion, baroclinic instability and dynamics of extratropical cyclones.</span><br/>

How does the chemical makeup of Earth make it suitable for life? And how does life in turn alter the chemistry of our planet? Biogeochemistry is the field of science that explores the imprint of biota (including humans) on the chemistry of the ocean, land and atmosphere. This interdisciplinary field addresses global problems, including climate change feedbacks, air quality, land use change, and marine ecosystem health. We will provide an overview</span><span class="deschide"> of the major biogeochemical cycles, discuss the biogeochemistry of major ecosystems, and introduce the major biogeochemical questions being asked today.

We will go through simplified physical processes associated with recent climate events and delve into the details of how they occur and to what extent climate extremes are trending. One of the important learning objectives is to provide dual learning, that is, I propose to offer upper level undergraduates that lack sufficient mathematics and physics, while at the same provide graduate students and atmospheric science/statistics undergraduates a detailed understanding of climate impacts and risks.

This course seeks to trace the rise of the anthropogenic epoch as a political epistemology, changing material milieu, and amorphous and contested political signifier. The notion of the Anthropocene challenges the very boundaries of nature and culture that have plagued and defined modernity. Natural forces and inanimate objects from storms and bodies, ocean flows and river currents, soil layers and chemical reactions are more and more commonly understood as always</span><span class="deschide"> already natural/cultural. What are the differential ways that the universal categories of the human at the heart of the concept of the Anthropocene mask the differential responsibility and liability for these epochal changes?<br/></span><br/>

This course introduces ways of seeing, describing, interpreting, and speculating on how everyday American built environments have given shape and meaning to social life. To that end, it surveys transformations in the country’s vernacular urban, suburban, and (to some extent) rural landscapes, at several scales: houses, yards, storefronts, parks, street patterns, workplaces, transit infrastructures, billboards, gas stations, and more. Addressed at one</span><span class="deschide"> level to landscape as material culture, the course also assembles an eclectic intellectual history of lay and official attempts to study, define, critique, make sense of, represent, and intervene on ordinary Americans and their space. Readings include primary as well as secondary sources.</span><br/>

This course examines how today’s bounded geographies were shaped by racialized and regionalized discourse and practice, setting the foundation for contemporary struggles over political, economic and social identities along and across Latin America. Specifically, the course incorporates the study of the United States’ historical relationship with Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean in order to understand how these histories map onto the productions of borders</span><span class="deschide">, regimes of migration and citizenship, and movements that increasingly articulate a decolonial turn in intellectual thought and within political and social action.<br/></span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>All human activity takes place on a geographic stage of great diversity and constant transformation. For more than a century, the Geography Department at Berkeley has been a leading center of scholarship about earth’s landscapes and human relationships to the environment. Our inquiries encompass a wide range of topics, from the economies and cultures of cities and built landscapes, to tropical climates and the flow of polar ice sheets. We combine rigorous empirical work with deeply conceptual theoretical analyses, always recognizing the importance of both spatial processes and accumulated histories. We use geographic analyses to illuminate the abiding problems of the modern world.</p>
<p>The Geography Department provides a broad-ranging perspective on humans as inhabitants and transformers of the face of the earth. The search for this kind of understanding involves thorough study of (a) the interlocking systems of the natural environment (climate, landforms, oceans, biota) and the evaluation of natural resources; (b) those diverse historical, cultural, social, economic, and political structures and processes which affect the location and spatial organization of population groups and their activities; and (c) significant geographical units, whether described as cities, regions, nations, states or landscapes, where integrated interpretation can be attempted, and a variety of problems thereby better understood.</p>
<p>As geographic theory and research has expanded their horizons over the past quarter-century, three research focuses have emerged to define geography at Berkeley: </p>
<p class="introtext"><strong><em>Earth System Science (a.k.a. Physical Geography)</em></strong></p>
<p>This branch of geography focuses on the study of the interconnected components of our environment—the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere—and how they interact to produce an integrated whole. It utilizes the fundamental disciplines of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology and applies them in the context of human activities and landscapes to understand the Earth, at scales ranging from single watersheds to the entire globe.</p>
<p>The research of our Earth Systems Science faculty epitomizes this interdisciplinary and global approach, and with expertise in biogeochemistry, biogeography, climate dynamics and climate change, geomorphology, glaciology, hydrology, and terrestrial ecology. Our research spans all corners of the world—from the swamps of the Everglades to the tundra of Alaska, from the ocean-atmosphere systems of the tropical Pacific to the vast ice sheets of Antarctica.</p>
<p class="introtext"><em><strong>Economy, Culture and Society (a.k.a. Human Geography)</strong></em></p>
<p>Human geography is a social science distinguished by its attention to the relation of humanity to the earth, in two regards. The first concerns the interaction of people with nature, including the extraction of natural resources, the environmental impact of people and their activities, and the effects of natural forces on society. The second concerns the spatial organization of societies at all scales from the local to the global (and from minutes to millennia) and the production of place, territory, and landscape by human imagination and activity.</p>
<p>Our Economy, Culture and Society faculty and graduate students work all around the world and explore an enormous range of topics: forest and range utilization in North America, urban development in China, agrarian change and resource extraction in Africa, conflict and human rights in Latin America, and much more. We examine borders and migration, conservation and development, globalization and governance while attending closely to the roles of race, gender, and class and of science, technology, and economy in shaping the world around us.</p>
<p class="introtext"><em><strong>Geospatial Representation and Analysis</strong></em></p>
<p>Advances in digital technologies have revolutionized how scholars, governments, businesses, and non-profit organizations collect, store, analyze and represent information about space, place, flows and locations. Even as the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has become ubiquitous, it has been superseded for research purposes by advances in spatial analysis, simulation modeling, remote sensing, web-based mapping, and geo-visualization. These technologies apply to the study of biophysical and social systems alike, and they are beginning to show potential to erode the practical and pedagogical obstacles that have historically separated quantitative and qualitative methods, Human and Physical Geography. Our faculty use them to model global climate and coastal sediment dynamics, gentrification, segregation, transit and public health. We encourage students to use these tools critically and creatively to answer pressing questions about the contemporary world. </p>
<h3 class="tglhead"><strong>Bachelor of Arts in Geography</strong></h3>
<p>The undergraduate major in geography is unusually broad and diverse, including the study of cultural, economic, political, historical, biophysical, urban and regional geography as well as cartography, quantitative methods, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing and fieldwork. Backgrounds in the natural and social sciences, history, and statistical methods may be useful to the geography major, with the mix and emphasis depending on the student's particular interests. Completing a major in geography requires the satisfactory completion of three lower division courses and eight upper division courses. Lower division requirements ensure that all students gain a broad understanding of the discipline, while upper division requirements are structured to allow students to specialize in the areas of their greatest interest.</p>
<p>Geography students are expected to have diverse interests and independent thought. The department welcomes students from a variety of backgrounds, including those with professional experience who wish to deepen their education. Students are encouraged to roam freely through the curriculum and to follow their inspiration where it leads while working in tandem with faculty advisers. </p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://geography.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><h3 class="tglhead"><strong>Declaring the Major</strong></h3>
<p>Students may declare the geography major after completing at least 30 units, with a 2.0 or better cumulative Berkeley GPA, and after completion of at least two of the three lower division requirements. Junior transfer students should declare their major during the beginning of their second semester at Berkeley. </p>
<p>To declare a major in geography, please schedule an appointment with the Undergraduate Major Advisor, Sarah Varner, here: <a href="https://calendly.com/svarner-geography" target="_blank">https://calendly.com/svarner-geography</a>. </p>
<p>The major requires a student to take <strong>three lower division courses</strong>, one in each of these areas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Basic Physical Geography</li>
	<li>World Geography</li>
	<li>Regional Geography</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to declare the major, a student must have taken and successfully passed at least <strong>TWO</strong> lower division courses, one from each area.<br/>

<p><br/>
Upon declaring the major and completing the three lower division course requirements, students will need to complete <strong>eight upper division courses</strong> in order to satisfy the requirements of the major. </p>
<p>All newly declared geography majors will need to choose one of the two specialty groups: <strong>Earth System Science</strong> (physical geography) or<strong> Economy, Culture and Society</strong> (human geography). <span>Please read more </span><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/geography/" target="_blank">about the geography program</a><span> for insight into the two specialty groups housed within the major. </span></p>
<p>The eight upper division courses span the two different specialty groups as well as a third section for methodology courses.</p>
<p>Both of the specialty groups have <strong>ONE</strong> required core course:</p>
<ul>
	<li>All students choosing the Earth System Science option must take <strong>Geography 140A.</strong></li>
	<li>All students choosing the Economy, Culture and Society option must take <strong>Geography 110</strong> -OR- <strong>Geography 130</strong>.</li>
	<li>Additionally, all students, regardless of their chosen specialty group, are required to take at least <strong>ONE </strong>methodology course as part of their upper division requirements.<br/>

<strong>5-2-1 Plan or 4-2-2 Plan</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, the geography department utilizes two plans by which students can complete their eight upper division requirements: the <strong>5-2-1 plan</strong> or the <strong>4-2-2 plan</strong>.</p>
<p>In both plans, the first number represents the number of courses a student must take in their chosen specialty group, while the second number represents the number of courses they must take in the other specialty group. The third number refers to the number of methodology courses a student must take.</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of each plan:</p>
<p><strong>5-2-1 Plan</strong></p>
<p>A total of 8 upper division courses, with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>5 courses from your chosen specialty group</li>
	<li>2 courses from the other specialty group</li>
	<li>1 methodology course</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4-2-2 Plan</strong></p>
<p>A total of 8 upper division courses, with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>4 courses from your chosen specialty group</li>
	<li>2 courses from the other specialty group</li>
	<li>2 methodology courses</li>
</ul>
<p>The 5-2-1 and 4-2-2 plans are not set in stone and can be changed easily during the progression of the major. Please consult with the UMA if you have questions about changing your plan.</p>
<h3 class="tglhead"><strong>Academic Performance Requirements</strong></h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a Pass/No Pass basis only.</li>
	<li>GEOG H195A/H195B, GEOG 197, GEOG 198, and GEOG 199 cannot be used to satisfy a major or minor program requirement.</li>
	<li>All students must complete at least one semester of residence in the major before graduation.</li>
	<li>Students are expected to enroll in at least 13 units per semester, with 15 units being considered a normal course load. The maximum number of units allowed per semester is 20.5; for unique situations, exceptions can be granted to exceed the maximum. Please meet with the UMA to discuss your request to exceed the semester unit cap.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average of a 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>
	<li>Students must learn at least a C- in all courses required for the major, including lower and upper division courses.</li>
</ol>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students are welcome to declare a minor in geography to complement their academic study in another department. The minor will be noted officially on a student's transcript in the memoranda section, but will not be included on the official diploma.</p>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>The geography minor is comprised of any five upper division courses, as long as one course is selected from each specialty group (physical geography and human geography).</li>
	<li>All five upper division courses counting toward the minor must be taken for a letter grade.</li>
	<li>At least three of the five courses must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Students interested in the geography minor should schedule a meeting with the UMA in order to declare the minor.</p>

The goals of this introductory Earth System Science course are to achieve a scientific understanding of important problems in global environmental change and to learn how to analyze a complex system using scientific methods. Earth System Science is an interdisciplinary field that describes the cycling of energy and matter between the different spheres (atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, and lithosphere) of the earth system. Under</span><span class="deschide"> the overarching themes of human-induced climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and biodiversity loss, we will explore key concepts of solar radiation, plate tectonics, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and the history of life on Earth.</span><br/>

Postcolonial studies focus on how processes of colonialism/imperialism continue even after the formal dissolution of empire. A central argument of this course is that critical human geography can make important contributions to understanding the interconnections between forces at play in different parts of the world.

It is primarily focused on the U.S., but will draw on select examples from abroad. We will investigate urbanization as a general process and the resulting physical, social, cultural, and political economic forms of cities and examine the ways that cities have addressed tensions emerging from segregation and urban renewal.</span><span class="deschide"> We will also look at both the ways in which social inequality is reinforced through the politics, policies, and design of the built environment as well as strategies for fostering and nurturing inclusive and equitable urban spaces through city design and policy.</span><br/>

The American city, palimpsest of a nation. It all comes together in the modern metropolis: economy, society, politics, culture, and geography. Cities as the economic engines of capitalism, centers of industry, finance, business, consumption, and innovation. Cities as political powers and political pawns, and the government of cities, suburbs, and metropolitan areas. Cities as magnificent constructs, built of concrete, credit and land rents</span><span class="deschide">, from skyscrapers to housing tracts, freeways to shopping malls, airports to open spaces. Cities as landscapes of social division by class, race and nationality, and the turf battles from mean ghetto streets to the hideaways of privilege.</span><br/>

How does the chemical makeup of Earth make it suitable for life? And how does life in turn alter the chemistry of our planet? Biogeochemistry is the field of science that explores the imprint of biota (including humans) on the chemistry of the ocean, land and atmosphere. This interdisciplinary field addresses global problems, including climate change feedbacks, air quality, land use change, and marine ecosystem health. We will provide an overview</span><span class="deschide"> of the major biogeochemical cycles, discuss the biogeochemistry of major ecosystems, and introduce the major biogeochemical questions being asked today. We also cover measurement techniques, including hands-on activities to introduce students to experimental methods and data analysis.</span><br/>

Through class discussions and homework assignments students will learn of historic climate catastrophes, how different societies have responded and what we can learn from these responses in terms of building climate resilience. We will go through simplified physical processes associated with recent climate events and delve into the details of how they occur and to what extent climate extremes are trending. One of the important learning objectives is to provide dual learning, that is, I propose to offer upper level undergraduates that lack sufficient mathematics and physics, while at the same provide graduate students and atmospheric science/statistics undergraduates a detailed understanding of climate impacts and risks. Graduate students have an augmented set of homework problems.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> An expected learning outcome is the ability to articulate climate risk with clear descriptions of mechanisms of change, degree and likelihood of impacts and methods of risk reduction. This class and Climates of the World will essentially be a two-semester sequence that (1) introduces students to the basic concepts of meteorology, climate change, climate extremes and (2) the types of risks and strategies that are currently being implemented and are in planning stages.</p></div>

This course introduces ways of seeing, describing, interpreting, and speculating on how everyday American built environments have given shape and meaning to social life. To that end, it surveys transformations in the country’s vernacular urban, suburban, and (to some extent) rural landscapes, at several scales: houses, yards, storefronts, parks, street patterns, workplaces, transit infrastructures, billboards, gas stations, and more. Addressed at one</span><span class="deschide"> level to landscape as material culture, the course also assembles an eclectic intellectual history of lay and official attempts to study, define, critique, make sense of, represent, and intervene on ordinary Americans and their space.

A spatial analytic approach to digital mapping and GIS. Given that recording the geolocation of scientific, business and social data is now routine, the question of what we can learn from the spatial aspect of data arises. This class looks at challenges in analyzing spatial data, particularly scale and spatial dependence. Various methods are considered such as hotspot detection, interpolation, and map overlay.
