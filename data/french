				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p><span>The undergraduate major in French is designed to allow students to acquire competence in the written and spoken language as well as a familiarity with the literature and culture of France and the French-speaking world. It aims to develop the student’s critical appreciation of texts in French in both literary and cultural contexts. The department thus offers a large selection of courses in different periods and schools of criticism, as well as courses in composition, stylistics, translation, and linguistics. Furthermore, it encourages interdisciplinary studies in French through courses emphasizing the relation between literature and the other arts and between literature, history, and society. Particularly attractive for many students is the opportunity for the historical and critical study of French film. Most courses are conducted in French, and majors are expected to write papers and examinations in that language.</span></p>
<p>Given the breadth of its program, the French major may interest students desiring a general humanistic education based on the language and literature of the French-speaking world; students planning to teach French at the elementary or secondary level; students who intend to pursue graduate work in preparation for teaching and research at the college level; and students preparing for careers in such areas as international law, business, or government service, which require both training in a major foreign language and/or a general background in a humanistic discipline.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students may declare the major at any point in their French studies, provided they have completed a minimum of 30 units of UCB coursework. To declare a major in French, students complete the <a href="https://french.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/Undergraduate-Application-to-the-Major-rev-FALL-18-2.pdf">departmental application form </a>and submit it in person or via email to the <a href="http://french.berkeley.edu/staff/carol-dolcini/">Undergraduate Advisor</a>. The form is also available in the French Department Undergraduate Office in 4209 Dwinelle. Applications to the major are accepted Fall, Spring and Summer semesters.</p>
<p>Students who are considering a major in French are encouraged to consult with the undergraduate advisor before declaring the major for help in deciding whether this major is appropriate for their academic goals, and for referrals to others who can assist in this decision. If a decision to major in French is reached, the undergraduate advisor will aid in planning the undergraduate program. The department strongly urges all majors to establish contact early with the undergraduate advisor to get answers to a broad range of questions regarding the French major and other issues related to completing the bachelor’s degree at Berkeley.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Senior French majors with both an overall grade point average of 3.5 and a grade point average (GPA) in French of 3.5 may apply to the honors program in French. Students meeting these criteria may obtain the application from the undergraduate adviser in 4209 Dwinelle Hall. After verification of GPA and proof that the student is in the final two semesters at Berkeley has been submitted to the undergraduate advisor, students prepare and submit a written proposal to both the major advisor and the supervisor of the thesis detailing the subject of the thesis. Upon admission to the honors program, students undertake research on an approved topic of their choice. The results of this research constitute an honors essay.</p>
<p><span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=FRENCH%20H195A" title="FRENCH H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'FRENCH H195A');">FRENCH H195A</a></span>-<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=FRENCH%20H195B" title="FRENCH H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'FRENCH H195B');">FRENCH H195B</a></span> is a two-semester sequence (2 units each semester); credit and grade are awarded upon completion of the sequence. Students should therefore begin the sequence no later than the semester before their final semester at Berkeley</p>

<p>The honors program is taken in addition to the eight upper division course, 32 upper division unit requirement for the major and does not count toward these minimums. The thesis may not be used as a paper or thesis for any other class or department.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of French offers a general minor in French. For information regarding prerequisites and minor requirements, please see the Minor Requirements tab at the top right of this page.</p>
<p>Students who intend to complete the minor in French should submit an <a href="http://french.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/Application-to-the-General-Minor-in-French.pdf">Application to the General Minor in French</a> no later than the semester before their Expected Graduation Term. Students should keep in contact with the Undergraduate Advisor in French as they complete coursework for the minor.</p>
<p>To complete the minor, students download and fill out the form called  “<a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/tools/forms-and-petitions-ls-undergraduate-advising">Completion of L&amp;S Minor</a>“. This petition is necessary for the official notation of the French Minor to appear on students’ transcripts. This form must be completed and submitted by Friday of RRR week of a student’s Expected Graduation Term. <em>Students are responsible for the timely completion and submission of these forms.</em> All petitions are reviewed and approved by the Undergraduate Advisor in French.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://french.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

<h3>Outside Electives</h3>
<p>Examples of outside electives approved in the past are listed below, but students may propose other courses to the undergraduate adviser for approval. These elective courses are designed to allow students to pursue interests of their own within the major, e.g., a concentration in linguistic study, or certain themes in literature and civilization. It is strongly recommended that all French majors take a French history course offered by the History Department.</p>
<p>All outside courses, whether listed below or not, require prior approval by the undergraduate adviser to count toward the major. Please note that only one outside elective may be used to satisfy major requirements.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript.  They are not noted on the diploma.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>  All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>
	<li>You must declare the minor no later than the last day of instruction (RRR week) of your final term. If you are finishing in summer, you must declare by the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare, select 'Tools' from the menu on the left, then 'Forms &amp; Petitions.' Download and complete the 'Completion of L&amp;S Minor' form, obtain the required signature from your Major Advisor, and submit the form to your Minor Advisor.</li>
	<li>Completion of a minor program is posted on the transcript alongside your major. Minor programs are not noted on diplomas.</li>

				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Study Abroad</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://studyabroad.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley Study Abroad Program</a> offers opportunities for study in France for one semester, for one year, or for the summer.</p>
<p>The majority of students in the French major and minor programs at UC Berkeley complete some portion of their undergraduate study abroad through the <a href="http://studyabroad.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley Study Abroad Program</a>. Given the increasing globalization of the world, living abroad helps expand students' understanding of diverse, culturally rooted attitudes and behaviors. Studying abroad enhances cross-cultural awareness, competency, and adaptability. Students find that living and studying abroad expands their perspective, improves critical thinking, increases independence, and better prepares them for a career in an increasingly competitive world.</p>
<p>Interested students should obtain the relevant information <em>early </em>in the semester preceding the one in which they plan to go abroad from the Berkeley Study Abroad office, located in 160 Stephens Hall, 510-642-1356, <a href="mailto:studyabroad@berkeley.edu">studyabroad@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Students should consult with the undergraduate adviser before going abroad (whether through Berkeley Study Abroad or through non-UC sponsored programs) in order to determine whether their program of study will count toward their French major or minor.</p>
<h4>Applying Study Abroad Coursework toward French Major/Minor Requirements</h4>
<p>When determining equivalent coursework for Berkeley Study Abroad courses, it is a question of equivalent content at an equivalent level. Courses must correspond in content and level to UC Berkeley upper division French courses required for the major or minor.</p>
<p>Criteria for determining if coursework is equivalent:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Course must be taught in French.</li>
	<li>Content of the course must be equivalent to upper division French courses offered at UC Berkeley. This means most courses in French Literature, French Linguistics, French Film, and Advanced French Language Study will be good candidates.</li>
	<li>
	<p>Course hours must be (approximately) equivalent to upper division French courses offered at UC Berkeley (about 4 semester units).</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>Final approval of equivalent coursework is granted after the student returns from study abroad, and the course grades and units have been posted to the student’s UC Berkeley transcript.</p>
<p>Coursework completed in the UCEAP Language and Culture programs is not considered equivalent to third- and fourth-year level French courses at UC Berkeley, and thus cannot be applied toward required upper division courses for the French major or minor.</p>
<p>Student’s equivalent courses from study abroad can be applied toward a maximum of four French major course requirements. No more than one course per semester may be taken on a P/NP basis for major/minor credit.</p>
<p>For additional information, contact Carol Dolcini, Undergraduate French Adviser, at <a href="mailto:frendept@berkeley.edu">frendept@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>
