				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>An international leader in social work practice and social policy, Berkeley Social Welfare has prepared over 11,000 social work professionals and social welfare scholars for a range of leadership, research, teaching, and advanced practice roles. Since 1942 we have offered the u<span>ndergraduate major in Social Welfare leading to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, u</span><span>nder the jurisdiction of the College of Letters &amp; Science. Berkeley Social Welfare's B.A. degree program was ranked #1 by USA Today College Factual in 2016.</span></p>
<h2>Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Social Welfare</h2>
<p>The Social Welfare undergraduate major emphasizes an educational experience that is grounded in the liberal arts rather than specialized training in the profession of social work—thus its designation as a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, and not the professional Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) degree. </p>
<p>The Undergraduate Social Welfare major reflects Berkeley Social Welfare’s goal to provide Berkeley undergraduate students with a broad-based introduction to America’s social welfare problems and social policies within a social science context. Students gain knowledge of organized networks of public and private social services, and the basic practice methods associated with the social work profession. In doing so, students acquire the knowledge needed to understand, address, and actively participate in the amelioration of critical social problems in American society.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://socialwelfare.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit School Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><h2>Declaring the Social Welfare Major</h2>
<p>Students interested in declaring the Social Welfare major should thoroughly explore the Social Welfare field as a major; become familiar with the curriculum and its required sequence; and complete the prerequisite entry requirements as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Social Welfare is a <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/planning/schedule-planning/choosing-major/high-demand-majors" target="_blank">high-demand major</a>.</strong> <strong>Prerequisites are strictly enforced and enrollment controls are in place for required courses to manage student demand.</strong> There are also limitations on the number of major declarations we are able to accommodate each year. </p>
<h3><strong>Prerequisite Entry Requirements</strong></h3>
<p>Before petitioning to declare the Social Welfare major, students must complete all of the prerequisites listed below. Prerequisites should be completed as soon as possible since student demand for the Social Welfare major currently exceeds the total number of majors we are able to accommodate.</p>
<p>All prerequisite courses must be successfully completed with a<strong> minimum letter grade of C</strong>. Prerequisites can be satisfied at Berkeley, or through <a href="http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/transfer/general-education-igetc/igetc/index.html" target="_blank">IGETC</a> or <a href="http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html" target="_blank">UC Reciprocity</a> for transfer students. High school AP scores that are high enough to provide credit for university units can be accepted in place of a prerequisite class.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Fulfillment of the L&amp;S Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) Requirement:</strong><br/>
	The College of Letters &amp; Science (L&amp;S) requires two semesters of lower division work in composition, <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/reading-composition-requirement" target="_blank">Reading and Composition (R&amp;C)</a>, parts A and B, in sequential order. All undergraduates must complete the R&amp;C requirement by the end of their fourth semester. </li>
	<li><strong>Fulfillment of the L&amp;S Quantitative Reasoning Requirement OR a Berkeley Data Science Course:</strong><br/>
	All L&amp;S students must complete a minimum of three (3) units of approved <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/quantitative-reasoning" target="_blank">Quantitative Reasoning coursework</a> in math, statistics, or computer science. This requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course. The prerequisite entry requirement for the Social Welfare major may also be satisfied by taking a <a href="http://data.berkeley.edu/courses" target="_blank">Berkeley Data Science course</a>.</li>

</ol>

<h3><strong>When and How to Declare the Major</strong></h3>
<p>Students must be accepted into and declared in the Social Welfare major in order to be eligible for enrollment in the introductory course <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span>. Because enrollment in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span> is restricted to majors, students should be declared by the time the pre-enrollment period begins ahead of the semester in which they plan to take <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span>.</p>

<p>Students may petition to declare the Social Welfare major as soon as they have completed the prerequisite entry requirements. Students who enter UC Berkeley as freshmen and intend to major in Social Welfare should complete prerequisites and declare the major as soon as possible. Past trends indicate a student should complete the prerequisites by the end of their 3rd semester to declare the major in a timely manner for graduation within eight semesters at Berkeley. All students <strong>must</strong> declare a major before the beginning of their Junior year, or the College of Letters and Science may block registration. Also, because Social Welfare is currently a high-demand major, all students must petition to declare the Social Welfare major by the time they have accrued 80 units, including work in progress (AP, IB, and college units earned before high school graduation are excluded from the 80-unit accrual total). Transfer students<strong> must</strong> declare a major by the start of their second semester at Berkeley, or the College of Letters &amp; Science may block registration.</p>
<p>Students are eligible to submit the Petition to Declare e-Form once they have satisfied all of the prerequisite entry requirements and received a letter grade for each course. Petitions must include unofficial transcripts and a 4-year program plan indicating how the applicant intends to complete the major requirements by their expected graduation date. For assistance with program planning, please make plans to meet with a major advisor or attend an information session. Incomplete applications will not be considered.</p>
<h2><span>Degree Requirements</span></h2>
<p>To earn the Bachelor of Arts degree in Social Welfare, students must satisfy all requirements of the University of California, the Berkeley campus and the College of Letters &amp; Science (see College Requirements tab), in addition to the requirements for the Social Welfare major.  </p>
<p><span>Social Welfare majors must complete four required upper division social welfare courses and a minimum of five approved social science electives, totaling at least 18 units, from other departments.</span></p>
<p>All courses used to fulfill major requirements must be taken for a <strong>letter grade</strong>. In order to graduate. Social Welfare majors must earn a minimum 2.0 GPA in all courses taken to fulfill major requirements.</p>

<p>Berkeley Social Welfare is a participating department in the <a href="http://www.berkeleyconnect.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Berkeley Connect</a> academic mentoring program for undergraduate majors. Undergraduate students are paired with a graduate student mentor from the Social Welfare doctoral program. Participants are grouped by declared or intended major to allow students to discover mutual academic interests. Over the course of a semester, enrolled students participate in regular small-group discussions facilitated by a graduate student mentor (following a faculty-directed curriculum), meet with their graduate student mentor for one-on-one advising, attend lectures and panel discussions featuring department faculty and alumni, and go on field trips to campus resources.</p>
<h2>Social Welfare Undergraduate Honors Program</h2>
<p>The honors program in social welfare provides an opportunity for qualified undergraduates to investigate thoroughly an area of interest, to work closely with a faculty member, and to produce a paper of some magnitude. Students who meet the eligibility requirements, which include a 3.5 grade point average (GPA) overall and in the major core courses, and completion of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span>, are invited to apply to the Senior Honors Program.

The fall H195 (one unit) is a two-hour biweekly seminar addressing topic identification, library research, and the preparation of an annotated bibliography and essay prospectus. The spring H195 (three units) is an individual tutorial in which students prepare the honors thesis essay under the supervision of a faculty adviser.</p>

America's recognition of and response to major social problems usually involves a mix of hyperbole and denial, inaction and innovation, volunteerism and professionalization, feasts and famines of resources, media applause and attack, and unsustained successes and long-term failures. What is usually lacking is a consistent, thoughtful effort. Yet help is given and lives are changed</span><span class="deschide">, for better and sometimes worse. Social Welfare 20 considers the American approach to social problems through an examination of issues such as substance abuse, mental illness, poverty and inequality, homelessness, family violence, and child maltreatment. Each area will be explored in terms of history, causes and dimensions, and human service and social policy responses.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>An international leader in social work practice and social policy, Berkeley Social Welfare has prepared over 11,000 social work professionals and social welfare scholars for a range of leadership, research, teaching, and advanced practice roles. Since 1942 we have offered the u<span>ndergraduate major in Social Welfare leading to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, u</span><span>nder the jurisdiction of the College of Letters &amp; Science. Berkeley Social Welfare's B.A. degree program was ranked #1 by USA Today College Factual in 2016.</span></p>
<h2>Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Social Welfare</h2>
<p>The Social Welfare undergraduate major emphasizes an educational experience that is grounded in the liberal arts rather than specialized training in the profession of social work—thus its designation as a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, and not the professional Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) degree. </p>
<p>The Undergraduate Social Welfare major reflects Berkeley Social Welfare’s goal to provide Berkeley undergraduate students with a broad-based introduction to America’s social welfare problems and social policies within a social science context. Students gain knowledge of organized networks of public and private social services, and the basic practice methods associated with the social work profession. In doing so, students acquire the knowledge needed to understand, address, and actively participate in the amelioration of critical social problems in American society.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://socialwelfare.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit School Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><h2>Declaring the Social Welfare Major</h2>
<p>Students interested in declaring the Social Welfare major should thoroughly explore the Social Welfare field as a major; become familiar with the curriculum and its required sequence; and complete the prerequisite entry requirements as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Social Welfare is a <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/planning/schedule-planning/choosing-major/high-demand-majors" target="_blank">high-demand major</a>.</strong> <strong>Prerequisites are strictly enforced and enrollment controls are in place for required courses to manage student demand.</strong> There are also limitations on the number of major declarations we are able to accommodate each year. </p>
<h3><strong>Prerequisite Entry Requirements</strong></h3>
<p>Before petitioning to declare the Social Welfare major, students must complete all of the prerequisites listed below. Prerequisites should be completed as soon as possible since student demand for the Social Welfare major currently exceeds the total number of majors we are able to accommodate.</p>
<p>All prerequisite courses must be successfully completed with a<strong> minimum letter grade of C</strong>. Prerequisites can be satisfied at Berkeley, or through <a href="http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/transfer/general-education-igetc/igetc/index.html" target="_blank">IGETC</a> or <a href="http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html" target="_blank">UC Reciprocity</a> for transfer students. High school AP scores that are high enough to provide credit for university units can be accepted in place of a prerequisite class.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Fulfillment of the L&amp;S Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) Requirement:</strong><br/>
	The College of Letters &amp; Science (L&amp;S) requires two semesters of lower division work in composition, <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/reading-composition-requirement" target="_blank">Reading and Composition (R&amp;C)</a>, parts A and B, in sequential order. All undergraduates must complete the R&amp;C requirement by the end of their fourth semester. </li>
	<li><strong>Fulfillment of the L&amp;S Quantitative Reasoning Requirement OR a Berkeley Data Science Course:</strong><br/>
	All L&amp;S students must complete a minimum of three (3) units of approved <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/quantitative-reasoning" target="_blank">Quantitative Reasoning coursework</a> in math, statistics, or computer science. This requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course. The prerequisite entry requirement for the Social Welfare major may also be satisfied by taking a <a href="http://data.berkeley.edu/courses" target="_blank">Berkeley Data Science course</a>.</li>

</ol>

<h3><strong>When and How to Declare the Major</strong></h3>
<p>Students must be accepted into and declared in the Social Welfare major in order to be eligible for enrollment in the introductory course <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span>. Because enrollment in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span> is restricted to majors, students should be declared by the time the pre-enrollment period begins ahead of the semester in which they plan to take <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span>.</p>

<p>Students may petition to declare the Social Welfare major as soon as they have completed the prerequisite entry requirements. Students who enter UC Berkeley as freshmen and intend to major in Social Welfare should complete prerequisites and declare the major as soon as possible. Past trends indicate a student should complete the prerequisites by the end of their 3rd semester to declare the major in a timely manner for graduation within eight semesters at Berkeley. All students <strong>must</strong> declare a major before the beginning of their Junior year, or the College of Letters and Science may block registration. Also, because Social Welfare is currently a high-demand major, all students must petition to declare the Social Welfare major by the time they have accrued 80 units, including work in progress (AP, IB, and college units earned before high school graduation are excluded from the 80-unit accrual total). Transfer students<strong> must</strong> declare a major by the start of their second semester at Berkeley, or the College of Letters &amp; Science may block registration.</p>
<p>Students are eligible to submit the Petition to Declare e-Form once they have satisfied all of the prerequisite entry requirements and received a letter grade for each course. Petitions must include unofficial transcripts and a 4-year program plan indicating how the applicant intends to complete the major requirements by their expected graduation date. For assistance with program planning, please make plans to meet with a major advisor or attend an information session. Incomplete applications will not be considered.</p>
<h2><span>Degree Requirements</span></h2>
<p>To earn the Bachelor of Arts degree in Social Welfare, students must satisfy all requirements of the University of California, the Berkeley campus and the College of Letters &amp; Science (see College Requirements tab), in addition to the requirements for the Social Welfare major.  </p>
<p><span>Social Welfare majors must complete four required upper division social welfare courses and a minimum of five approved social science electives, totaling at least 18 units, from other departments.</span></p>
<p>All courses used to fulfill major requirements must be taken for a <strong>letter grade</strong>. In order to graduate. Social Welfare majors must earn a minimum 2.0 GPA in all courses taken to fulfill major requirements.</p>

<p>Berkeley Social Welfare is a participating department in the <a href="http://www.berkeleyconnect.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Berkeley Connect</a> academic mentoring program for undergraduate majors. Undergraduate students are paired with a graduate student mentor from the Social Welfare doctoral program. Participants are grouped by declared or intended major to allow students to discover mutual academic interests. Over the course of a semester, enrolled students participate in regular small-group discussions facilitated by a graduate student mentor (following a faculty-directed curriculum), meet with their graduate student mentor for one-on-one advising, attend lectures and panel discussions featuring department faculty and alumni, and go on field trips to campus resources.</p>
<h2>Social Welfare Undergraduate Honors Program</h2>
<p>The honors program in social welfare provides an opportunity for qualified undergraduates to investigate thoroughly an area of interest, to work closely with a faculty member, and to produce a paper of some magnitude. Students who meet the eligibility requirements, which include a 3.5 grade point average (GPA) overall and in the major core courses, and completion of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span>, are invited to apply to the Senior Honors Program.

The fall H195 (one unit) is a two-hour biweekly seminar addressing topic identification, library research, and the preparation of an annotated bibliography and essay prospectus. The spring H195 (three units) is an individual tutorial in which students prepare the honors thesis essay under the supervision of a faculty adviser.</p>

America's recognition of and response to major social problems usually involves a mix of hyperbole and denial, inaction and innovation, volunteerism and professionalization, feasts and famines of resources, media applause and attack, and unsustained successes and long-term failures.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>An international leader in social work practice and social policy, Berkeley Social Welfare has prepared over 11,000 social work professionals and social welfare scholars for a range of leadership, research, teaching, and advanced practice roles. Since 1942 we have offered the u<span>ndergraduate major in Social Welfare leading to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, u</span><span>nder the jurisdiction of the College of Letters &amp; Science. Berkeley Social Welfare's B.A. degree program was ranked #1 by USA Today College Factual in 2016.</span></p>
<h2>Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Social Welfare</h2>
<p>The Social Welfare undergraduate major emphasizes an educational experience that is grounded in the liberal arts rather than specialized training in the profession of social work—thus its designation as a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, and not the professional Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) degree. </p>
<p>The Undergraduate Social Welfare major reflects Berkeley Social Welfare’s goal to provide Berkeley undergraduate students with a broad-based introduction to America’s social welfare problems and social policies within a social science context. Students gain knowledge of organized networks of public and private social services, and the basic practice methods associated with the social work profession. In doing so, students acquire the knowledge needed to understand, address, and actively participate in the amelioration of critical social problems in American society.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://socialwelfare.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit School Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><h2>Declaring the Social Welfare Major</h2>
<p>Students interested in declaring the Social Welfare major should thoroughly explore the Social Welfare field as a major; become familiar with the curriculum and its required sequence; and complete the prerequisite entry requirements as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Social Welfare is a <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/planning/schedule-planning/choosing-major/high-demand-majors" target="_blank">high-demand major</a>.</strong> <strong>Prerequisites are strictly enforced and enrollment controls are in place for required courses to manage student demand.</strong> There are also limitations on the number of major declarations we are able to accommodate each year. </p>
<h3><strong>Prerequisite Entry Requirements</strong></h3>
<p>Before petitioning to declare the Social Welfare major, students must complete all of the prerequisites listed below. Prerequisites should be completed as soon as possible since student demand for the Social Welfare major currently exceeds the total number of majors we are able to accommodate.</p>
<p>All prerequisite courses must be successfully completed with a<strong> minimum letter grade of C</strong>. Prerequisites can be satisfied at Berkeley, or through <a href="http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/transfer/general-education-igetc/igetc/index.html" target="_blank">IGETC</a> or <a href="http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html" target="_blank">UC Reciprocity</a> for transfer students. High school AP scores that are high enough to provide credit for university units can be accepted in place of a prerequisite class.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Fulfillment of the L&amp;S Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) Requirement:</strong><br/>
	The College of Letters &amp; Science (L&amp;S) requires two semesters of lower division work in composition, <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/reading-composition-requirement" target="_blank">Reading and Composition (R&amp;C)</a>, parts A and B, in sequential order. All undergraduates must complete the R&amp;C requirement by the end of their fourth semester. </li>
	<li><strong>Fulfillment of the L&amp;S Quantitative Reasoning Requirement OR a Berkeley Data Science Course:</strong><br/>
	All L&amp;S students must complete a minimum of three (3) units of approved <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/quantitative-reasoning" target="_blank">Quantitative Reasoning coursework</a> in math, statistics, or computer science. This requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course. The prerequisite entry requirement for the Social Welfare major may also be satisfied by taking a <a href="http://data.berkeley.edu/courses" target="_blank">Berkeley Data Science course</a>.</li>

<h3><strong>When and How to Declare the Major</strong></h3>
<p>Students must be accepted into and declared in the Social Welfare major in order to be eligible for enrollment in the introductory course <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span>. Because enrollment in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span> is restricted to majors, students should be declared by the time the pre-enrollment period begins ahead of the semester in which they plan to take <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span>.</p>

<p>Students may petition to declare the Social Welfare major as soon as they have completed the prerequisite entry requirements. Students who enter UC Berkeley as freshmen and intend to major in Social Welfare should complete prerequisites and declare the major as soon as possible. Past trends indicate a student should complete the prerequisites by the end of their 3rd semester to declare the major in a timely manner for graduation within eight semesters at Berkeley. All students <strong>must</strong> declare a major before the beginning of their Junior year, or the College of Letters and Science may block registration. Also, because Social Welfare is currently a high-demand major, all students must petition to declare the Social Welfare major by the time they have accrued 80 units, including work in progress (AP, IB, and college units earned before high school graduation are excluded from the 80-unit accrual total). Transfer students<strong> must</strong> declare a major by the start of their second semester at Berkeley, or the College of Letters &amp; Science may block registration.</p>
<p>Students are eligible to submit the Petition to Declare e-Form once they have satisfied all of the prerequisite entry requirements and received a letter grade for each course. Petitions must include unofficial transcripts and a 4-year program plan indicating how the applicant intends to complete the major requirements by their expected graduation date. For assistance with program planning, please make plans to meet with a major advisor or attend an information session. Incomplete applications will not be considered.</p>
<h2><span>Degree Requirements</span></h2>
<p>To earn the Bachelor of Arts degree in Social Welfare, students must satisfy all requirements of the University of California, the Berkeley campus and the College of Letters &amp; Science (see College Requirements tab), in addition to the requirements for the Social Welfare major.  </p>
<p><span>Social Welfare majors must complete four required upper division social welfare courses and a minimum of five approved social science electives, totaling at least 18 units, from other departments.</span></p>
<p>All courses used to fulfill major requirements must be taken for a <strong>letter grade</strong>. In order to graduate. Social Welfare majors must earn a minimum 2.0 GPA in all courses taken to fulfill major requirements.</p>

<p>Berkeley Social Welfare is a participating department in the <a href="http://www.berkeleyconnect.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Berkeley Connect</a> academic mentoring program for undergraduate majors. Undergraduate students are paired with a graduate student mentor from the Social Welfare doctoral program. Participants are grouped by declared or intended major to allow students to discover mutual academic interests. Over the course of a semester, enrolled students participate in regular small-group discussions facilitated by a graduate student mentor (following a faculty-directed curriculum), meet with their graduate student mentor for one-on-one advising, attend lectures and panel discussions featuring department faculty and alumni, and go on field trips to campus resources.</p>
<h2>Social Welfare Undergraduate Honors Program</h2>
<p>The honors program in social welfare provides an opportunity for qualified undergraduates to investigate thoroughly an area of interest, to work closely with a faculty member, and to produce a paper of some magnitude. Students who meet the eligibility requirements, which include a 3.5 grade point average (GPA) overall and in the major core courses, and completion of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span>, are invited to apply to the Senior Honors Program.

The fall H195 (one unit) is a two-hour biweekly seminar addressing topic identification, library research, and the preparation of an annotated bibliography and essay prospectus. The spring H195 (three units) is an individual tutorial in which students prepare the honors thesis essay under the supervision of a faculty adviser.</p>

America's recognition of and response to major social problems usually involves a mix of hyperbole and denial, inaction and innovation, volunteerism and professionalization, feasts and famines of resources, media applause and attack, and unsustained successes and long-term failures. What is usually lacking is a consistent, thoughtful effort. Yet help is given and lives are changed</span><span class="deschide">, for better and sometimes worse. Social Welfare 20 considers the American approach to social problems through an examination of issues such as substance abuse, mental illness, poverty and inequality, homelessness, family violence, and child maltreatment.

In this interdisciplinary course students examine the relationships among social science, law, and crime prevention policy. Emphasis is placed on how psychological science (clinical, developmental, social) can inform decisions about individuals at high risk for repeated involvement in the juvenile and criminal justice systems. Topics of focus include risk assessment, adolescent development and juvenile justice, and prevention/intervention/correctional</span><span class="deschide"> psychology. Students will have an opportunity to master a specific problem area. Broadly, goals are for students to a) become comfortable in translating crime prevention problems into social scientific questions, and b) specifically understand how research findings can inform law and policy.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>An international leader in social work practice and social policy, Berkeley Social Welfare has prepared over 11,000 social work professionals and social welfare scholars for a range of leadership, research, teaching, and advanced practice roles. Since 1942 we have offered the u<span>ndergraduate major in Social Welfare leading to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, u</span><span>nder the jurisdiction of the College of Letters &amp; Science. Berkeley Social Welfare's B.A. degree program was ranked #1 by USA Today College Factual in 2016.</span></p>
<h2>Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Social Welfare</h2>
<p>The Social Welfare undergraduate major emphasizes an educational experience that is grounded in the liberal arts rather than specialized training in the profession of social work—thus its designation as a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, and not the professional Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) degree. </p>
<p>The Undergraduate Social Welfare major reflects Berkeley Social Welfare’s goal to provide Berkeley undergraduate students with a broad-based introduction to America’s social welfare problems and social policies within a social science context. Students gain knowledge of organized networks of public and private social services, and the basic practice methods associated with the social work profession. In doing so, students acquire the knowledge needed to understand, address, and actively participate in the amelioration of critical social problems in American society.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://socialwelfare.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit School Website</a></p>

<p>Students interested in declaring the Social Welfare major should thoroughly explore the Social Welfare field as a major; become familiar with the curriculum and its required sequence; and complete the prerequisite entry requirements as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Social Welfare is a <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/planning/schedule-planning/choosing-major/high-demand-majors" target="_blank">high-demand major</a>.</strong> <strong>Prerequisites are strictly enforced and enrollment controls are in place for required courses to manage student demand.</strong> There are also limitations on the number of major declarations we are able to accommodate each year. </p>
<h3><strong>Prerequisite Entry Requirements</strong></h3>
<p>Before petitioning to declare the Social Welfare major, students must complete all of the prerequisites listed below. Prerequisites should be completed as soon as possible since student demand for the Social Welfare major currently exceeds the total number of majors we are able to accommodate.</p>
<p>All prerequisite courses must be successfully completed with a<strong> minimum letter grade of C</strong>. Prerequisites can be satisfied at Berkeley, or through <a href="http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/transfer/general-education-igetc/igetc/index.html" target="_blank">IGETC</a> or <a href="http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html" target="_blank">UC Reciprocity</a> for transfer students. High school AP scores that are high enough to provide credit for university units can be accepted in place of a prerequisite class.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Fulfillment of the L&amp;S Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) Requirement:</strong><br/>
	The College of Letters &amp; Science (L&amp;S) requires two semesters of lower division work in composition, <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/reading-composition-requirement" target="_blank">Reading and Composition (R&amp;C)</a>, parts A and B, in sequential order. All undergraduates must complete the R&amp;C requirement by the end of their fourth semester. </li>
	<li><strong>Fulfillment of the L&amp;S Quantitative Reasoning Requirement OR a Berkeley Data Science Course:</strong><br/>
	All L&amp;S students must complete a minimum of three (3) units of approved <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/quantitative-reasoning" target="_blank">Quantitative Reasoning coursework</a> in math, statistics, or computer science. This requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course. The prerequisite entry requirement for the Social Welfare major may also be satisfied by taking a <a href="http://data.berkeley.edu/courses" target="_blank">Berkeley Data Science course</a>.</li>

<h3><strong>When and How to Declare the Major</strong></h3>
<p>Students must be accepted into and declared in the Social Welfare major in order to be eligible for enrollment in the introductory course <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span>. Because enrollment in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span> is restricted to majors, students should be declared by the time the pre-enrollment period begins ahead of the semester in which they plan to take <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span>.</p>

<p>Students may petition to declare the Social Welfare major as soon as they have completed the prerequisite entry requirements. Students who enter UC Berkeley as freshmen and intend to major in Social Welfare should complete prerequisites and declare the major as soon as possible. Past trends indicate a student should complete the prerequisites by the end of their 3rd semester to declare the major in a timely manner for graduation within eight semesters at Berkeley. All students <strong>must</strong> declare a major before the beginning of their Junior year, or the College of Letters and Science may block registration. Also, because Social Welfare is currently a high-demand major, all students must petition to declare the Social Welfare major by the time they have accrued 80 units, including work in progress (AP, IB, and college units earned before high school graduation are excluded from the 80-unit accrual total). Transfer students<strong> must</strong> declare a major by the start of their second semester at Berkeley, or the College of Letters &amp; Science may block registration.</p>
<p>Students are eligible to submit the Petition to Declare e-Form once they have satisfied all of the prerequisite entry requirements and received a letter grade for each course. Petitions must include unofficial transcripts and a 4-year program plan indicating how the applicant intends to complete the major requirements by their expected graduation date. For assistance with program planning, please make plans to meet with a major advisor or attend an information session. Incomplete applications will not be considered.</p>
<h2><span>Degree Requirements</span></h2>

<p>Berkeley Social Welfare is a participating department in the <a href="http://www.berkeleyconnect.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Berkeley Connect</a> academic mentoring program for undergraduate majors. Undergraduate students are paired with a graduate student mentor from the Social Welfare doctoral program. Participants are grouped by declared or intended major to allow students to discover mutual academic interests. Over the course of a semester, enrolled students participate in regular small-group discussions facilitated by a graduate student mentor (following a faculty-directed curriculum), meet with their graduate student mentor for one-on-one advising, attend lectures and panel discussions featuring department faculty and alumni, and go on field trips to campus resources.</p>
<h2>Social Welfare Undergraduate Honors Program</h2>
<p>The honors program in social welfare provides an opportunity for qualified undergraduates to investigate thoroughly an area of interest, to work closely with a faculty member, and to produce a paper of some magnitude. Students who meet the eligibility requirements, which include a 3.5 grade point average (GPA) overall and in the major core courses, and completion of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span>, are invited to apply to the Senior Honors Program.

The fall H195 (one unit) is a two-hour biweekly seminar addressing topic identification, library research, and the preparation of an annotated bibliography and essay prospectus. The spring H195 (three units) is an individual tutorial in which students prepare the honors thesis essay under the supervision of a faculty adviser.</p>

America's recognition of and response to major social problems usually involves a mix of hyperbole and denial, inaction and innovation, volunteerism and professionalization, feasts and famines of resources, media applause and attack, and unsustained successes and long-term failures. What is usually lacking is a consistent, thoughtful effort. Yet help is given and lives are changed</span><span class="deschide">, for better and sometimes worse. Social Welfare 20 considers the American approach to social problems through an examination of issues such as substance abuse, mental illness, poverty and inequality, homelessness, family violence, and child maltreatment. Each area will be explored in terms of history, causes and dimensions, and human service and social policy responses.</span><br/>

In this interdisciplinary course students examine the relationships among social science, law, and crime prevention policy. Emphasis is placed on how psychological science (clinical, developmental, social) can inform decisions about individuals at high risk for repeated involvement in the juvenile and criminal justice systems. Topics of focus include risk assessment, adolescent development and juvenile justice, and prevention/intervention/correctional</span><span class="deschide"> psychology. Students will have an opportunity to master a specific problem area.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>An international leader in social work practice and social policy, Berkeley Social Welfare has prepared over 11,000 social work professionals and social welfare scholars for a range of leadership, research, teaching, and advanced practice roles. Since 1942 we have offered the u<span>ndergraduate major in Social Welfare leading to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, u</span><span>nder the jurisdiction of the College of Letters &amp; Science. Berkeley Social Welfare's B.A. degree program was ranked #1 by USA Today College Factual in 2016.</span></p>
<h2>Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Social Welfare</h2>
<p>The Social Welfare undergraduate major emphasizes an educational experience that is grounded in the liberal arts rather than specialized training in the profession of social work—thus its designation as a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, and not the professional Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) degree. </p>
<p>The Undergraduate Social Welfare major reflects Berkeley Social Welfare’s goal to provide Berkeley undergraduate students with a broad-based introduction to America’s social welfare problems and social policies within a social science context. Students gain knowledge of organized networks of public and private social services, and the basic practice methods associated with the social work profession. In doing so, students acquire the knowledge needed to understand, address, and actively participate in the amelioration of critical social problems in American society.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://socialwelfare.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit School Website</a></p>

<h3><strong>Prerequisite Entry Requirements</strong></h3>
<p>Before petitioning to declare the Social Welfare major, students must complete all of the prerequisites listed below. Prerequisites should be completed as soon as possible since student demand for the Social Welfare major currently exceeds the total number of majors we are able to accommodate.</p>

<h3><strong>When and How to Declare the Major</strong></h3>
<p>Students must be accepted into and declared in the Social Welfare major in order to be eligible for enrollment in the introductory course <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span>. Because enrollment in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span> is restricted to majors, students should be declared by the time the pre-enrollment period begins ahead of the semester in which they plan to take <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span>.</p>

<p>Students may petition to declare the Social Welfare major as soon as they have completed the prerequisite entry requirements. Students who enter UC Berkeley as freshmen and intend to major in Social Welfare should complete prerequisites and declare the major as soon as possible. Past trends indicate a student should complete the prerequisites by the end of their 3rd semester to declare the major in a timely manner for graduation within eight semesters at Berkeley. All students <strong>must</strong> declare a major before the beginning of their Junior year, or the College of Letters and Science may block registration. Also, because Social Welfare is currently a high-demand major, all students must petition to declare the Social Welfare major by the time they have accrued 80 units, including work in progress (AP, IB, and college units earned before high school graduation are excluded from the 80-unit accrual total). Transfer students<strong> must</strong> declare a major by the start of their second semester at Berkeley, or the College of Letters &amp; Science may block registration.</p>
<p>Students are eligible to submit the Petition to Declare e-Form once they have satisfied all of the prerequisite entry requirements and received a letter grade for each course. Petitions must include unofficial transcripts and a 4-year program plan indicating how the applicant intends to complete the major requirements by their expected graduation date. For assistance with program planning, please make plans to meet with a major advisor or attend an information session. Incomplete applications will not be considered.</p>

<p>Berkeley Social Welfare is a participating department in the <a href="http://www.berkeleyconnect.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Berkeley Connect</a> academic mentoring program for undergraduate majors. Undergraduate students are paired with a graduate student mentor from the Social Welfare doctoral program. Participants are grouped by declared or intended major to allow students to discover mutual academic interests. Over the course of a semester, enrolled students participate in regular small-group discussions facilitated by a graduate student mentor (following a faculty-directed curriculum), meet with their graduate student mentor for one-on-one advising, attend lectures and panel discussions featuring department faculty and alumni, and go on field trips to campus resources.</p>
<h2>Social Welfare Undergraduate Honors Program</h2>
<p>The honors program in social welfare provides an opportunity for qualified undergraduates to investigate thoroughly an area of interest, to work closely with a faculty member, and to produce a paper of some magnitude. Students who meet the eligibility requirements, which include a 3.5 grade point average (GPA) overall and in the major core courses, and completion of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SOC%20WEL%20110" title="SOC WEL 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SOC WEL 110');">SOC WEL 110</a></span>, are invited to apply to the Senior Honors Program.

The fall H195 (one unit) is a two-hour biweekly seminar addressing topic identification, library research, and the preparation of an annotated bibliography and essay prospectus. The spring H195 (three units) is an individual tutorial in which students prepare the honors thesis essay under the supervision of a faculty adviser.</p>

America's recognition of and response to major social problems usually involves a mix of hyperbole and denial, inaction and innovation, volunteerism and professionalization, feasts and famines of resources, media applause and attack, and unsustained successes and long-term failures. What is usually lacking is a consistent, thoughtful effort. Yet help is given and lives are changed</span><span class="deschide">, for better and sometimes worse. Social Welfare 20 considers the American approach to social problems through an examination of issues such as substance abuse, mental illness, poverty and inequality, homelessness, family violence, and child maltreatment. Each area will be explored in terms of history, causes and dimensions, and human service and social policy responses.</span><br/>

In this interdisciplinary course students examine the relationships among social science, law, and crime prevention policy. Emphasis is placed on how psychological science (clinical, developmental, social) can inform decisions about individuals at high risk for repeated involvement in the juvenile and criminal justice systems. Topics of focus include risk assessment, adolescent development and juvenile justice, and prevention/intervention/correctional</span><span class="deschide"> psychology. Students will have an opportunity to master a specific problem area. Broadly, goals are for students to a) become comfortable in translating crime prevention problems into social scientific questions, and b) specifically understand how research findings can inform law and policy.</span><br/>
