				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Department of History offers a program of instruction ranging widely over the historical record of human experience. The chronological, geographical, and topical range affords great flexibility to students working toward degrees in history and to those who wish to give a historical dimension to their studies in other disciplines. History at Berkeley is a highly flexible major that allows students to follow their interests. It is also a major that places strong value on original student research, with all students completing capstone projects on topics they choose in consultation with members of the faculty.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students may declare the major after completing three letter-graded courses in the Department of History with a 2.0 grade-point average (GPA) or better. This must include at least two lower division courses.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To graduate with honors in History, a major must achieve a general GPA of 3.5, a departmental GPA of 3.7, and a minimum grade of &quot;A-&quot; in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTORY%20101" title="HISTORY 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTORY 101');">HISTORY 101</a></span>. To be eligible for graduation with high or highest honors in History, a major must complete the one-year thesis program, achieve a general GPA of 3.5, a departmental GPA of 3.7, and a grade of &quot;A&quot; in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTORY%20101" title="HISTORY 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTORY 101');">HISTORY 101</a></span>. The student must also receive a nomination for high or highest honors from the 101 instructor. The decision to award high or highest honors rests with the Honors Committee.</p>

<p>A major who is eligible for honors after completing <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTORY%20101" title="HISTORY 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTORY 101');">HISTORY 101</a></span> (but not the one-year thesis program) and is interested in continued research may pursue a second thesis project under the rubric <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTORY%20H195" title="HISTORY H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTORY H195');">HISTORY H195</a></span>. The second project may substitute for the 101 thesis in determining eligibility for high or highest honors if the student meets the GPA standards and receives a nomination from the H195 instructor.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of History offers a minor in History.</p>
<p><span>Students are encouraged to meet with the minor adviser to file a &quot;History Minor Application&quot; as soon as they have completed one course towards the minor. In addition to turning in the application, students who have taken their lower division minor course elsewhere should provide an unofficial copy of the transcript showing the course that satisfies the minor and the grade received.</span></p>
<p>All students must submit a completed “History Minor Application” and an L&amp;S “Minor Completion” petition by the minor declaration deadline once they have enrolled in or completed the course that will complete the minor. The deadline is May first for the spring and November first for the fall. The application and completion forms may be submitted simultaneously. </p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://history.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

<h3>Field of Concentration Requirement</h3>
<p>At least four of the eight upper-division courses must constitute a Field of Concentration, which shall be defined by one of the following rubrics:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a period (such as “The Ancient World,” “The Medieval World,” “The Twentieth Century,” or a similarly broad temporal span)</li>
	<li>a geographical area (such as “Eastern Europe,” “China,” “The Mediterranean,” or a similarly broad spatial expanse)</li>
	<li>a thematic approach (such as “Science and Medicine,” “Law,” “Popular Culture,” “Religion,” or a similarly broad subject matter)</li>
</ul>
<p>The four courses constituting the Field of Concentration must include History 101.The three additional courses in the Field may include a course from the History 103 series. They may also include one appropriate upper-division course (of at least three units) from another department (in consultation with the Undergraduate Advisor.)</p>
<h3><span>Pre-Modern Requirement</span></h3>
<p>At least one course used to fulfill the major requirements must be devoted entirely to pre-modern history, to be selected from courses focused on one or more of the following eras: antiquity, the classical period, and the medieval period. Courses dealing solely with the early modern period do not satisfy this requirement.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>The History minor consists of six four-unit courses: one lower division and five upper division, from at least two of the seven historical fields below.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade.</li>

While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation.

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The History major helps students learn to think critically and deeply about the historical processes that have shaped the world we live in. History majors are exposed to a temporally and geographically broad range of historical experience, but they are also required to concentrate on a world region or theme or a period in history, both in order to develop depth of understanding and in order to prepare for the capstone of the History Major: an article-length, primary-source based, original research project. The major is designed to develop critical reading, thinking, and writing skills that will be needed to succeed in this capstone course.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Distinguish and characterize significant periods of historical experience in multiple societies from different parts of the globe.</li>
	<li>Describe events and developments in the history of multiple societies in terms of continuity, change, and causation.</li>
	<li>Understand interpretive debates about the past.</li>
	<li>Appreciate the complexities involved in interpreting societies and social change: for example, the local and the global, particular and general, contingent and structural.</li>
	<li>Identify different kinds of historical evidence and understand their role in the production of historical knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Recall factual claims about the past and synthesize them into coherent interpretive arguments.</li>
	<li>Read documents closely and critically.</li>
	<li>Formulate a well-organized, well-supported argument.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate clear writing in the form of essays of varying lengths.</li>
	<li>Make cogent oral arguments about reading assignments in the context of a seminar discussion.</li>
	<li>Conduct original research with primary sources.</li>
	<li>Locate good, relevant secondary scholarship, and distinguish good from poor scholarship.</li>
	<li>Observe ethical practices of citation and intellectual self-presentation.</li>
</ol>

This course is an introduction to the history of the United States from the beginning of the European colonization of North America to the end of the Civil War. It is also an introduction to the ways historians look at the past and think about evidence.

What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class. Here we will track America's rise to global power, the fate of freedom in a post-Emancipation political setting, and the changing boundaries of nation, citizenship, and community. We will use landmark events to sharpen our themes, but we will also</span><span class="deschide"> take care to analyze the equally important (and shifting) patterns of where and how Americans lived, worked, and played.</span><br/>

The goal of this course is to foster a critical engagement with humanitarian interventions in Africa. Through this course, we will develop a better understanding of the complexity of humanitarianism and its often-unintended consequences in different parts of Africa. Our approach is not prescriptive in the sense that it provides a course of action or a politics to follow. Instead, we use historical methodology as an analytical tool in evaluating</span><span class="deschide"> the connections between humanitarianism and Africa over more than two hundred years.</span><br/>

Neoliberalism has become a catch-word in social sciences. It is used by scholars from various disciplines and has different meanings. However, usually it is used to indicate some profound change that took place since the 1970s. Some even use it to describe the three decades that have followed the postwar period. In this seminar we will approach neoliberalism from a historical perspective, including the history of neoliberal ideas, neoliberal</span><span class="deschide"> transformations in a number of selected countries, the 2008-9 economic crisis, the neoliberalization of higher education, and the contentious relationship between neoliberalism and democracy. We will end with an outlook on the future of neoliberalism.</span><br/>

In 2011, Bill Gates and David Christian launched a project for teaching “Big History” at high schools. In their definition, “Big History seeks to understand the integrated history of the Cosmos, Earth, Life, and Humanity, using the best available empirical evidence and scholarly methods.” The vocabulary, concepts, and environmental fears driving the project are distinctly twenty-first century. However, humanity has sought the exact same goals</span><span class="deschide"> for longer than two millennia already. The course will sample how ancient Greek philosophy and science were used in order to propose practically and morally relevant “Big History” at different times and places: Graeco-Roman antiquity, the Christian and Muslim Middle Ages, and the modern period.</span><br/>

A paradox lies at the heart of our visions of present-day South Asia: on the one hand, the region has witnessed explosive economic growth, leading some to speak of the next hundred years as an ‘Asian Century’. On the other hand, the countries of the region remain beset by enormous challenges, from the shadow of terrorism, the threat of nuclear war, the increasingly rapid slide into authoritarianism, the growth of religious violence and fundamentalism</span><span class="deschide">, resource scarcity and the looming environmental catastrophe – to name only a few. This course will explore this paradox through works of reportage, fiction and contemporary history from across the Indian subcontinent today.</span><br/>

This course covers the history of Scandinavian political society from the Viking invasions to the formation of kingdoms. After examining the attacks on England and the European Continent, discussion turns to Viking mythology, the colonization of the North Atlantic (including Vinland), and Icelandic feuding. A fair amount of attention will be devoted to archaeological excavations. The course also works with Norse mythologies, and the ways</span><span class="deschide"> the history of early Scandinavian kings was grafted into those mythologies.

Sample topics to be explored include: definitions</span><span class="deschide"> of childhood and child labor; traditional constructions of children's work; colonialism, globalization and redefinition of children's work; gender and child labor; child abductions, child soldiers; sex slavery; and talibes.</span><br/>

Shanghai’s opening to foreign trade and residence after 1842 sparked its rapid growth into China’s largest metropolis, and one of the great cities of the world, less than a century later.

This course explores African history before 1800: How and why did complex societies form in Africa? Why did states form in some place and times and not others? What technological responses did different Africans make to environmental changes? How did various cultures, religions, and state ideologies help to organize African social and political formations? What effect did the medieval and early-modern trade in African slaves have on African social</span><span class="deschide"> and political formations? We will attempt to answer these questions from both theoretical and historiographical perspectives by engaging with academic debates on some of these issues, and by looking at the viewpoints of African historical actors themselves using primary sources.</span><br/>

Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of</span><span class="deschide"> women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard?

Between the 16th and the 19th century China was home to the world’s largest empire and economy. Beijing sat at the center of an East Asian order of trade, tribute, and learning. China reached the height of its continental power around 1800. Meanwhile Western European ships began sailing into East Asian waters. These ships facilitated long-distance exchanges of goods and ideas by the sea.<br/>
This course examines the question: What mattered</span><span class="deschide"> more in the shaping of modern China thereafter: the Inner Asian origins of the Chinese governing system or the dynamics of a globalizing maritime economy and society? To anchor the discussion, the course will focus on aspects of law and society.</span><br/>

It is impossible to understand Chinese history and culture without knowing what ordinary people thought, felt, and believed. In this course, our primary concerns will be 1) the built environment -- village form, houses, temples; 2) village festivals and domestic rituals; 3) the rituals and scriptures of local cults; 4) operas, storytelling, and other forms of village entertainment; and 5) popular visual arts. These subjects will be studied</span><span class="deschide"> through both written and visual documentation.</span><br/>

This course brings a thematic approach to the critical analysis of the visual in Chinese history. In focusing on key elements of material culture and emphasizing how they have been viewed at specific moments in Chinese history, the course teaches students of history how to achieve a more balanced picture of the past drawn from both visual and literary records. Inevitably, the course tries to determine for a particular temporal and geographical setting</span><span class="deschide"> what's ordinary or conventional and what's not; also to rethink the metaphors that currently dominate thinking about history in China. No prior acquaintance with Chinese history is required for the course.</span><br/>

During the first half-century before World War II, the United States became an industrialized, urban society with national markets and communication media. This class will explore in depth some of the most important changes and how they were connected. We will also examine what did not change, and how state and local priorities persisted in many arenas. Among the topics addressed: population movements and efforts to control immigration; the growth</span><span class="deschide"> of corporations and trade unions; the campaign for women's suffrage; Prohibition; an end to child labor; the institution of the Jim Crow system; and the reshaping of higher education.</span><br/>

Immediately prior to World War II, the US military ranked 17th in the world, most African-Americans lived in the rural south and were barred from voting, culture and basic science in the United States enjoyed no world-wide recognition, most married women did not work for wages, and the census did not classify most Americans as middle-class or higher.

The U.S. military has served as an engine of socio-economic mobility, and changes in its personnel policies often foreshadowed the reordering of American society. However, the U.S. military has also been a space in which the federal government actively discriminated against many Americans—people of color, women, immigrants, religious minorities, and queer people. This course is neither a history of American wars nor a traditional military history focused on battles</span><span class="deschide"> and strategy; rather it explores the social dynamics of the U.S. military from the American Revolution to the present and investigates how the military has reflected, resisted, influenced, and heralded social, cultural, political, and religious transformations in American life.</span><br/>

In this course we will be discussing key developments in U.S. thought since the middle of the nineteenth century, roughly beginning with the reception of Darwin. The broader story told in the class weaves together in the history of science and engineering, the arts and popular culture, philosophy, and education. Our goal is to trace how ideas, whether they are dominant, challenging, or look back, have affected the ways in which Americans</span><span class="deschide"> live together. We will look at how intellectual life has empowered and expanded the capacity of Americans to understand their world and achieve goals more effectively.

As longstanding symbols in U.S. history and culture, “Wall Street” and “Main Street” refer to streets that intersect at right angles and places that represent the antithesis of each other: Wall Street is home to nefarious big banks run by greedy financiers, while Main Street is home to “mom-and-pop” shops patronized by people of modest means who live in the surrounding wholesome small towns.

For most of human history, urban living has been the experience of a distinct minority. Only in the past two hundred years have the physicial spaces, social relations, and lifestyles associated with large cities entered the mainstream. This course examines the long century of urban growth between 1825 and 1933, when big cities came into being in the United States. Focusing on large metropolitian centers (especially on New York, Chicago, and</span><span class="deschide"> San Francisco), we will study the way urban spaces provided sites and sources of new modes of personal interaction, popular entertainment, social conflict, and political expression.</span><br/>

The early colonial period in the Americas is one of history’s most traumatic, astonishing, and consequential eras. This class compares and contrasts histories of encounter, resistance, conquest, and colonialization in four regions of indigenous America: Hispaniola, the Valley of Mexico, the St. Lawrence River Valley, and the Chesapeake. Each section will begin with regional geography and indigenous/European contexts. In the process, we will be interrogating the dynamics</span><span class="deschide"> that gave rise to the complex and profoundly unequal American societies of the early colonial period, with their stratified, diverse populations of colonized and independent indigenous peoples, enslaved Africans, Europeans, and growing populations of mixed ancestry.</span><br/>

World War II lifted the U.S. from the Great Depression and launched a long economic boom that helped underwrite and propel efforts on behalf of greater racial equality and economic equity. As that boom began to fade in the late 1960s, America’s march toward greater racial equality foundered, while its march toward greater economic equity began to reverse course. The Civil Rights Era gave way to the New Gilded Age. This course will explore the political, legal, and</span><span class="deschide"> economic history of America’s struggles for racial equality and economic equity – and the relationship between them.</span><br/>

How have inhabitants of Cuba struggled against ongoing relationships</span><span class="deschide"> of colonialism and dependency with foreign powers?

The course explores the culture of these dynamic urban communities, especially emphasizing the rich visual and material culture, as well as the particular relationship</span><span class="deschide"> between religion and society in Italy before the Renaissance.</span><br/>

This is a course about the history of Britain that asks why this small island nation was so central to how Europeans and others understood world history more generally. It looks at Britain as the paradigmatic venue of industrialization, class conflict or its absence, consumer culture, parliamentary democracy, religious tolerance, imperial expansion, and modernity generally. It begins with the aftermath of Europe's first revolution and ends with</span><span class="deschide"> the first world's fair, 1851's Great Exhibition.</span><br/>

For many years, Britain was seen as the crucible of the modern world.This small, cold, and wet island was thought to have been the first to develop representative democracy, an industrial economy,rapid transport, mass cities, mass communication and mass culture, and, of course, an empire upon which the sun famously never set.And yet, despite this precocious modernity, imperial Britain remained a deeply traditional society unable to rid itself</span><span class="deschide"> of ancient institutions like the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the established church. The focus of the course is on how this combination of the old and the new produced a broadly 'liberal' set of mentalities through which Britons came to understand and manage the great transformations of modern life.</span><br/>

The eighteenth century in Europe witnessed a series of &quot;revolutions&quot;--intellectual, political, and to a lesser extent, social and economic--that together constitute the birth rites of modern European society and culture. Historians collectively agree that the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the European expansion of Napoleonic France were events of world-historical significance, yet the causes and precise meaning of these</span><span class="deschide"> events are the subjects of substantial disagreement.

The course will explore the socio-economic and political factors that allowed France to emerge as the most powerful nation in Europe under Louis XIV. We will assess the extent of the kingdom's cultural influence and the realities of everyday life under the &quot;old regime.&quot; We will then examine the intellectual, social, political, and religious developments of the eighteenth</span><span class="deschide"> century--such as the Enlightenment, Jansenism, and colonialism--that ultimately led to a total assault against the monarchy in 1789, and finally, the outbreak, course, and consequences of the first great democratic revolution in modern Europe.</span><br/>

This course explores modern France and its place in the world. We begin with the French Revolution, one of the truly earth-shaking events in history, and then we follow French history through a series of monarchical, authoritarian, and democratic regimes. In the process, we will also trace the emergence, expansion and decline of a great colonial empire. Issues of focus include French cultural and intellectual life; empire as a way of life not</span><span class="deschide"> only for colonists but also for those living in mainland France; religion; immigration; battles over “who is French”; and dramatic changes in French economy and society during the past two centuries.</span><br/>

From the period of the Protestant Reformation to the era of enlightened despotism and the French Revolution, German history was characterized by severe conflicts and problems unresolved. Early Modern German history contains many lessons concerning the relationship of war and peace, of violence and toleration, of reform and renewal and the rejection of any change, of Baroque splendor and widespread misery, of some progress and much disappointment</span><span class="deschide">, in short: of a most complicated legacy for future generations.</span><br/>

This course provides the essential foundation for understanding the catastrophic history of Germany in the 20th Century, as well as some of its successes. A central theme is the struggle to define and impose a single national identity on socially, culturally, and religiously diverse peoples in an age of Great Power conflict. Although the region now known as Germany will be the focus of our investigation, considerable attention will also be paid</span><span class="deschide"> to the Hapsburg Empire, for until 1866 Austria was officially a part of &quot;Germany&quot; and remained, for nearly a century thereafter, culturally and in popular consciousness a part of a &quot;Greater Germany.&quot;</span><br/>

This course will focus on the history of Italy during a period when it was the leading center of European artistic and cultural production and the driving force in the revival of classical learning and literary ideals. This was the Italy of Raphael and Michelangelo, Ariosto and Alberti, Brunelleschi and Botticelli. At the same time, Italy was also a political battleground through most of this period, both in the realm of ideas and theory but</span><span class="deschide"> also in a literal sense. It was in Italy that &quot;the art of war,&quot; as Machiavelli called it, took center stage as the peninsula became one of the major theaters of war between the great powers of the age, France and Spain. The course will combine a study of the artistic, intellectual, religious, and political history of Italy in this period both as it developed internally and as it was related to the rest of Europe and the Mediterranean world. Requirements will include a midterm, a final, and an optional final paper.</span><br/>

The Romanovs ruled Russia from 1613 until 1917, when revolutions swept them from power. In three centuries, they transformed it from a landlocked country, inhabited largely by ethnic Russians, into a sprawling, western-oriented, multi-ethnic empire, governing well over 100 million people across some 8.6 million square miles. This course will focus on the techniques of rule that the Romanovs used to maintain and expand state power. It will inquire</span><span class="deschide"> into the extent and limits of the reach of the administrative and military apparatus into subjects’ public and private lives. Nominally, Russia was an autocracy. How powerful were Russia’s Romanov autocrats in practice? What can the Russian experience teach us about the nature of the modern state?</span><br/>

This course will examine the history of 20th-century Eastern Europe, understood as the band of countries and peoples stretching from the Baltics to the Balkans. Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, however, will receive special attention. Topics of study will include foundation of the national states, Eastern European fascism, Nazi occupation, contructing Stalinist socialism, the fate of reform communism, reconstitution of &quot;civil society</span><span class="deschide">,&quot; and the emergence of a new Eastern Europe. Given the paucity of historical writings on the region, the course will make extensive use of cinematic and literary portrayals of Eastern Europe.</span><br/>

This course uses the devices of historical and literary interpretation to expose and analyze some of the lines of political and cultural development that have led to the Poland we now know.Beginning with the awakening of modern Polish nationalism, it traces the emergence of this Poland through the rise of mass society; the horrifying and exhilarating spectacles of World War I and national and social revolutions; first experiments with modern</span><span class="deschide"> Polish statehood (especially policies toward ethnic minorities and socially marginalized groups); then the transformations wrought by a half century of totalitarian rule; ethnic cleansing, elite transfer, forces social stratification, and despite all of this, the defiant return of civil society.</span><br/>

Once again, Europeans are questioning the limits of coexistence. Recently we have watched a refugee crisis unfold and in the process have reopened discussions regarding who “belongs” in Europe. This course approaches these vexing question from a unique historical perspective, that of coexistence and otherness in both the “old” and “new” Europe. Specifically our laboratory includes Poland, the Czech Republic and</span><span class="deschide"> Germany. We will utilize five case studies (the Jews of Europe; the Roma of Northern Bohemia; the Vietnamese in Prague, the Turkish in Germany and recent refugees across the EU) to better understand how ideas of “Europe” and “Europeaness” changed over the past century.</span><br/>

This course will examine the impact of modern intellectual, political, cultural, and social forces on the Jewish people since the eighteenth century. It is our aim to come to an understanding of how the Jews interpreted these forces and how and in what ways they adapted and utilized them to suit the Jewish experience. In other words, we will trace the way Jews became modern. Some of the topics to be covered include Emancipation, the Jewish Enlightenment, new Jewish</span><span class="deschide"> religious movements, Jewish politics and culture, immigration, antisemitism, the Holocaust, and the state of Israel.</span><br/>

This class treats France and the Francophone world as a laboratory for the study of Jewish civilization over the past millennium. France has the world’s second largest Jewish population outside of Israel. It has a rich and complex history that traces all the key developments of the Jewish experience since ancient times: expulsions and migrations; codification of Jewish law; religious reform; the rise of anti-Semitism and the tragedy of the Holocaust; struggles between</span><span class="deschide"> Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews; complex relations between Muslims and Jews; the emergence modern Jewish politics; and the impact of the Israeli-Arab conflict.

We move through topics that include the earliest encounters between Muslims and Jews during the years of the rise of Islam; the historical impact and legacy of the dhimmi (the system of rights and restrictions that defined Jews’ status for centuries under Islamic rule); the culturally fruitful shared experience</span><span class="deschide"> of Jews and Muslims in Medieval Spain and the Ottoman Empire; the effects of French, British, and Italian colonialism in the modern Middle East; and the important conflicts over Zionism and Arab nationalism during the past century.</span><br/>

It explores the major themes in Jewish history from 1750 to the present, with special attention paid to the transformation of Jewish communal and individual identity in the modern world. Topics to be treated include the breakdown of traditional society, enlightenment and emancipation, assimilation, Hasidism, racial anti-Semitism</span><span class="deschide">, colonialism, Zionism, and contemporary Jewish life in Europe, North America, and Israel. The multicultural nature of Jewish history will be highlighted throughout the course through the treatment of non-European Jewish narratives alongside the more familiar Ashkenazi perspective.</span><br/>

This course examines the establishment of the ideas and institutions of modern physics over the last century and a half.We begin with the 19th century organization of the discipline and the debates over the classical world picture (mechanics, electromagnetism and optics, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics).We follow the dramatic changes that undid the classical picture, from the discovery of radioactivity through Einstein's theories of</span><span class="deschide"> relativity on to the creation of quantum mechanics and the accompanying philosophical disputes.Alongside these conceptual upheavals we will look at the evolving structure of the discipline, its links with industry and government, and the massive transformations of WWII, culminating in the atomic bomb.</span><br/>

The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e.</span><span class="deschide">, on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the &quot;outside&quot; world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.</span><br/>

By situating the major postwar upheavals - from decolonization to the Cold War; from population growth to environmental degradation; from globalization to the endurance of economic inequalities - in comparative and international contexts, this course encourages students to see the origins of our own times and dilemmas</span><span class="deschide"> in their proper historical context and provides an introduction to recent international and gloal history.</span><br/>

A required class for students in the human rights minor (but open to others), this course examines the development of human rights. More than a history of origins, it explores the relationships between human rights and other crucial themes in the history of the modern era. As a history of international trends and an examination of specific practices, it will ask students to make comparisons across space and time and to reflect upon the evolution</span><span class="deschide"> of human rights in both thought and action.</span><br/>

In this course we explore the intersections of art and science in medieval, modern, and contemporary history. Our aim is twofold. First, to explore the close interaction between these two fields, and the way in which they have shaped each other through the ages. Second, to focus our attention on specific instances of art/science interaction, using them as prisms through which one can reach a fuller understanding of major historical transformations.</span><br/>

Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world. This class will explore how and why that came to happen. Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages</span><span class="deschide"> of players. We will locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity. The class will teach you both about the game and about thinking historically and how the world changes over time.</span><br/>

Students are not required to be declared majors in order to participate.</span><br/>
