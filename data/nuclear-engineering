				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The program is designed to prepare students for a career in industry, the national laboratories, or in state or federal regulatory agencies. The program, leading to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Nuclear Engineering, emphasizes study in the following areas of nuclear engineering: nuclear reactions and radiation, introduction to medical imaging, nuclear reactor theory and design, fusion power engineering, radioactive waste management, radiological and biophysics, and nuclear materials.</p>
<p>Many students will go on to complete a one-year master's degree program (the department does not have a fifth-year MS program). Students interested in careers in scientific research or in college-level teaching go on to complete the doctorate.</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>This program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of <a href="http://www.abet.org/">ABET</a>.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the College. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few, if any, spaces that open in the College each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor in Nuclear Engineering (NE) that is open to all students who are not majoring in NE and who have completed the necessary prerequisites for the minor requirements. For information regarding the prerequisites, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>The Nuclear Engineering (NE) minor is open to any undergraduate who satisfies the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Declaration of a major (not NE) on the UC Berkeley campus</li>
	<li>A cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 at the time of applying</li>
	<li>Completion of the minor must not delay graduation</li>
</ul>
<p>To apply for the minor, submit the <a href="http://coenuc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/UG-Admission-to-minor-in-NE.pdf">Petition for Admission to the Undergraduate Minor</a> to the undergraduate adviser after completion of the prerequisite courses. Upon completion of the minor requirements, submit a <a href="http://coenuc.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/UG-Completion-of-minor-in-NE-2.pdf">Petition for Completion of the Undergraduate Minor</a> to the undergraduate adviser.</p>
<h3>Joint Majors</h3>
<p>The Department of Nuclear Engineering also offers three joint majors with other departments in the College of Engineering and one joint major with a Department in the College of Chemistry. For further information on these programs, please click the links below:<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement.

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The mission of the Department of Nuclear Engineering is to maintain and strengthen the University of California's only center of excellence in nuclear engineering education and research and to serve California and the nation by improving and applying nuclear science and technology. The mission of the undergraduate degree program in Nuclear Engineering is to prepare our students to begin a lifetime of technical achievement and professional leadership in academia, government, the national laboratories, and industry.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>The foundation of the UC Berkeley Nuclear Engineering (NE) program is a set of five key objectives for educating undergraduate students. The NE program continuously reviews these objectives internally to ensure that they meet the current needs of the students, and each spring the Program Advisory Committee meets to review the program and recommend changes to better serve students. The NE Program Advisory Committee was established in 1988 and is composed of senior leaders from industry, the national laboratories, and academia.</p>
<p>Nuclear engineering at UC Berkeley prepares undergraduate students for employment or advanced studies with four primary constituencies: industry, the national laboratories, state and federal agencies, and academia (graduate research programs). Graduate research programs are the dominant constituency. From 2000 to 2005, sixty-eight percent of graduating NE seniors indicated plans to attend graduate school in their senior exit surveys. To meet the needs of these constituencies, the objectives of the NE undergraduate program are to produce graduates who as practicing engineers and researchers do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Apply solid knowledge of the fundamental mathematics and natural (both physical and biological) sciences that provide the foundation for engineering applications.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate an understanding of nuclear processes, and the application of general natural science and engineering principles to the analysis and design of nuclear and related systems of current and/or future importance to society.</li>
	<li>Exhibit strong, independent learning, analytical and problem solving skills, with special emphasis on design, communication, and an ability to work in teams.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate an understanding of the broad social, ethical, safety, and environmental context within which nuclear engineering is practiced.</li>
	<li>Value and practice life-long learning.</li>
</ol>
