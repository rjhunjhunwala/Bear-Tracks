				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Sustainable Environmental Design major recognizes that the emergent, multidisciplinary field of sustainability science is growing rapidly. As the world population urbanizes, the planning and design of resilient, resource-efficient, healthy and socially just cities and metropolitan regions is profoundly important. The College of Environmental Design, with its long-standing expertise in sustainable urbanism and design, is an ideal setting for an undergraduate major in sustainable environmental design, with a focus on the built environment.</p>
<p>The major offers students a critical understanding of the sustainability challenges facing urban regions in California and around the globe and equips them with the technical, analytic, and design tools key to devising creative solutions. Graduates have many career paths and fields of graduate study open to them. Students who complete this major will:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Understand the application of physical, biological, and social science in the design of sustainable cities and metropolitan regions.</li>
	<li>Understand sustainable urban technologies and design strategies.</li>
	<li>Comprehend issues of equity and social justice as they relate to sustainable cities and regions.</li>
	<li>Evaluate and monitor the present state and future potential of built environments in terms of sustainability.</li>
	<li>Comprehend the implications of policy and institutions and their potential to shape future sustainable cities and regions.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Program Overview</h3>
<p>Features of the major include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The gateway course, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LD%20ARCH%2012" title="LD ARCH 12" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LD ARCH 12');">LD ARCH 12</a></span>, Environmental Science for Sustainable Development, introduces students to the scientific basis of sustainability as explored through the study of energy, water, food, natural resources and the built environment, with a focus on the application of scientific insights to sustainable development strategies. The course emphasizes hands-on learning through field-based exercises such as measurement of atmospheric particulate matter, micro-climates, channel form, aquatic insects and water quality, and direct observations of green infrastructure, green building methods, and urban agriculture.</li>

	<li>A Critical Approaches course, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENV%20DES%20102" title="ENV DES 102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENV DES 102');">ENV DES 102</a></span>, Critical Debates in Sustainable Urbanism. The course challenges students to think critically about the idea of sustainability, develop critiques of current sustainable urbanism/design practice, and envision the institutional and behavioral changes required for a more sustainable future.</li>

	<li>A Methods/Technology course, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LD%20ARCH%20C188" title="LD ARCH C188" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LD ARCH C188');">LD ARCH C188</a></span> /<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GEOG%20C188" title="GEOG C188" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GEOG C188');">GEOG C188</a></span>, Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GIS has become a basic tool for a wide range of analytic tasks across all environmental design fields. The course addresses both GIS theory and applications, offering a dynamic analytical framework for gathering, integrating, interpreting, and manipulating temporal and spatial data.</li>

	<li>A set of upper division courses on energy and environment, deep green design, the nature of cities, planning for sustainability, ecological analysis, and sustainable cities and landscapes.</li>
	<li>A series of highly recommended <em>area concentrations </em>allowing students to specialize in a variety of aspects of sustainability such as economics, business, and policy, society, culture, and ethics, resources and environmental management, or design and technology.</li>
	<li>A capstone workshop course, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENV%20DES%20106" title="ENV DES 106" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENV DES 106');">ENV DES 106</a></span>, Sustainable Environmental Design Workshop. Linking sustainability science and technology with urban form and social dynamics, the workshop requires independent and collaborative research with an external client organization to offer innovative strategies for sustainable environmental design.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Recommended Sustainable Environmental Design Area Concentrations</h3>
<div>
<p>The intent of recommended area courses is to provide students with opportunities to deepen their knowledge about specific issues in sustainability. Each of the area courses focuses on an essential aspect of sustainability with the premise that urban sustainability is a multi-dimensional problem and sustainable environments emerge from the intersection of technology, design, economics, policy, and societal change.</p>

Advisors encourage students to explore their minds and their hearts, challenge them to do their best work, and help them realize their talents and passions and achieve their goals.</p>
<p><strong>Equity &amp; Inclusion.</strong> CED is committed to creating an inclusive environment in which any individual or group can be and feel welcomed, respected, supported, and valued. Advisors aspire to provide fair treatment, access, opportunity, and advancement for all students, and to identify and eliminate barriers that prevent the full participation of all.</p>
<p><strong>Health &amp; Well-Being.</strong> CED collaborates with campus partners to keep the community healthy by helping students balance the physical, intellectual, emotional, social, occupational, spiritual, and environmental aspects of life.</p>
<p><strong>Advising Excellence.</strong> In all that it does, the College strives to deliver personalized advising services of the highest quality by continuously educating itself on developments in the field and to evaluate, improve, and streamline services to support students in obtaining the best education and experience possible.</p>
