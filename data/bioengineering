				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<p>Applicants can apply after second semester sophomore year and up to first semester senior year. Applicants who have completed all of the courses prior to applying will not be accepted into the minor; <strong>students must apply first</strong>.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p><span>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. </span><span>To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum technical grade point average of 3.0 (math, science &amp; engineering courses) is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Please see more details at the <a href="http://bioeng.berkeley.edu/undergrad/bioeminor" target="_blank">department website</a>.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
</div>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Students should apply first, before taking courses.</strong> Applications are available in 306 Stanley Hall or <a href="http://bioeng.berkeley.edu/undergrad/bioeminor">on the department website</a>.

You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley.

<div id="stcpDiv">
<p>Since our founding in 1998, the BioE faculty have been working to create an integrated, comprehensive program. Much thought has been put into the question, “What does every bioengineer need to know?” The faculty have been engaged in considerable dialogue over the years about what needs to be included, in what order, and how to do so in a reasonable time frame. Balancing depth with breadth has been the key challenge, and we have reached a point where the pieces have come together to form a coherent bioengineering discipline.</p>
</div>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Describe the fundamental principles and methods of engineering.</li>
	<li>Understand the physical, chemical, and mathematical basis of biology.</li>
	<li>Appreciate the different scales of biological systems.</li>
	<li>Apply the physical sciences and mathematics in an engineering approach to biological systems.</li>
	<li>Effectively communicate scientific and engineering data and ideas, both orally and in writing.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the values of cooperation, teamwork, social responsibility, and lifelong learning necessary for success in the field.</li>
	<li>Design a bioengineering solution to a problem of technical, scientific. or societal importance.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate advanced knowledge in a specialized field of bioengineering.</li>

				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3><span>Undergraduate Research</span></h3>
<p>We believe it is essential for undergraduates to experience the hands-on application of skills to prepare them for a career in bioengineering. Every student is required to complete at least one semester of research or design before graduation, although most do more. This can be accomplished through our outstanding <a href="http://bioeng.berkeley.edu/undergrad/capstone" target="_blank">senior capstone design course</a>, or through other independent study options and research in faculty laboratories. A recent survey shows that 94% of our senior students have undertaken extracurricular research, usually starting in their sophomore year. For research resources, please visit the <a href="http://bioeng.berkeley.edu/undergrad/undergradresearch" target="_blank">department website</a>.</p>
<h3>Student Organizations</h3>
<p>There are several active student organizations related to bioengineering, focusing on academics, research, global healthcare, local outreach, social life, career planning, and other worthy efforts. For further information, please see the <a href="http://bioeng.berkeley.edu/resources/student-life">Student Life</a> page on the department website.</p>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> <br/>
Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
<br/>
•<br/>
Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
•<br/>
Understanding of the origin of surface forces and interfacial free energy, and how they contribute to the development of the biomaterial interface and ultimately biomaterial performance.<br/></p></div>

This course is aimed at graduate and advanced undergraduate students from the (bio) engineering and chemo-physical sciences interested in a research-oriented introduction to current topics in systems biology. Focusing mainly on two well studied microbiological model systems--the chemotaxis network and Lambda bacteriophage infection--the class systematically introduces key concepts and techniques for biological network deduction, modelling</span><span class="deschide">, analysis, evolution, and synthetic network design. Students analyze the impact of approaches from the quantitative sciences--such as deterministic modelling, stochastic processes, statistics, non-linear dynamics, control theory, information theory, graph theory, etc.--on understanding biological processes, including (stochastic) gene regulation, signalling, network evolution, and synthetic network design. The course aims to identify unsolved problems and discusses possible novel approaches while encouraging students to develop ideas to explore new directions in their own research.</span><br/>

The capabilities of optical microscopy will be compared with complementary techniques including</span><span class="deschide"> electron microscopy, coherence tomography, and atomic force microscopy. Students will also be responsible for researching their final project outside of class and presenting a specific application of modern microscopy to biological research as part of an end-of-semester project.</span><br/>

Biomedical imaging is a clinically important application of engineering, applied mathematics, physics, and medicine. In this course, we apply linear systems theory and basic physics to analyze X-ray imaging, computerized tomography, nuclear medicine, and MRI. We cover the basic physics and instrumentation that characterizes medical image as an ideal perfect-resolution image blurred by an impulse response. This material could prepare the student</span><span class="deschide"> for a career in designing new medical imaging systems that reliably detect small tumors or infarcts.</span><br/>
