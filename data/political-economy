				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Political Economy (PE) examines the relationship between politics and economics in modern societies and focuses on problems of both domestic and international policy. Based on the assumption that political-economic relationships are affected by any number of factors, such as society, culture, geography, and demographics, the curriculum is both multi and interdisciplinary in scope. The focus of the major is on contemporary issues, although a strong historical perspective is also emphasized. Students may also study planning and problem solving, environmental issues, resource distribution, and the challenges of institutional adaptation and changing political systems.</p>
<p>The major is designed to provide a broad-based liberal arts background as well as the intellectual skills appropriate for careers in either the public or private sector. Additionally, the major offers an excellent background for students planning postgraduate careers in social science disciplines or attending professional schools.</p>
<p>Some of the questions that the major addresses include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The tension between rising consumer demand and the need to minimize resource depletion and pollution.</li>
	<li>The different priorities served by a capitalist, socialist, and other varieties of political economy.</li>
	<li>The different priorities served by democratic, authoritarian, and other political systems.</li>
	<li>How international interdependence may undermine the efforts of national governments to cope with unemployment, inflation, trade and payment deficits, health, housing and welfare problems, and other socioeconomic issues.</li>
	<li>The importance of organizational structures for policy-making in both the public and private sectors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>

<h3><span>Honors Program</span></h3>
<p>To graduate with honors from the group major in PE, students must enroll in the two-semester honors seminar, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GLOBAL%20H102" title="GLOBAL H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GLOBAL H102');">GLOBAL H102</a></span> (fall only) and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span> (spring only) and must obtain a grade point average (GPA) of 3.6 in the major and 3.5 in overall University coursework. The honors seminar (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span>) is taken in addition to a student's regular course work for fulfilling requirements for the major and culminates in the writing of a senior thesis. To qualify for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span>, students must be recommended by the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GLOBAL%20H102" title="GLOBAL H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GLOBAL H102');">GLOBAL H102</a></span> instructor.

<h3>Foreign Language Requirement</h3>
<p>Political Economy (PE) majors must demonstrate proficiency in a modern language other than English by the last semester of their senior year. Proficiency is equivalent to the ability achieved in four college-level semesters (or two years). Language courses taken in high school do not satisfy this requirement. See below for details on how to fulfill the foreign language requirement.</p>
<p>Languages accepted by the College of Letters &amp; Science are not automatically accepted by the Political Economy program. Please check with a PE adviser for eligible languages.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to fulfill the four-semester language requirement for PE depending on the individual and his or her background and ability.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) test:</strong> An AP score of 5 or an International Baccalaureate (IB) score of 7 will complete this requirement. An AP score of 4 will place a student into the fourth-semester college-level course. A score of 3 will place a student into the third-semester college-level course. Documentation of AP scores must be provided.</li>
	<li><strong>Coursework: </strong>Any combination of college courses, summer programs, or college-level study abroad programs may satisfy the language requirement. Language classes are the only classes used to fulfill major requirements that may be taken for a letter grade or Pass/No Pass.  This includes the fourth semester. Language courses need not be taken at Berkeley. Courses taken at a community college or any accredited school or university may be acceptable. A one-semester upper division course taken abroad in the target language may satisfy the foreign language requirement, depending on the school and program followed. For more information, see a PE adviser concerning language study abroad.</li>
	<li><strong>Proficiency exam</strong>: Some, but not all, language departments on campus offer proficiency testing for students with advanced skills in that language. Please note that if a particular language is not taught on the UC Berkeley campus, then students are not able to test in that language. A student would then need to choose one of the other methods for fulfilling the foreign language requirement. Please speak with a PE adviser about proficiency testing.</li>
	<li><strong>High school completion in a non-English language</strong>: Students who were educated in a non-English language through the completion of high school or the equivalent may wish to satisfy this requirement with that experience. This requires a language proficiency exam. </li>
</ol>

<h3><span>Concentration</span></h3>
<p>The concentration is made up of four courses. Within the concentration, only two courses may be taken from the same department. Up to three courses taken abroad may count, provided they conform to the concentration topic; a syllabus in English must be provided.</p>
<p>The PE concentration is the theoretical focal point in the major. It is meant to give students the opportunity to deepen their understanding of political economy around an area of particular interest to them. The concentration is perhaps the greatest benefit of the Political Economy major because it allows students to apply the theoretical and methodological knowledge they have gained to a topic about which they feel particularly drawn or curious. Students spend four courses focusing on this material, so it is important for students to be thoughtful and develop a topic about which they enjoy learning.</p>
<p>To get started on the concentration, students should think about an existing or potential issue or question in political economy. Then they should choose four courses that will inform or increase their understanding about that issue. These courses should all relate to the topic as well as to one another. Students are encouraged to be imaginative in defining a concentration. A concentration issue is formulated by the student with the assistance of a PE advisor who can help to explain, clarify, or perhaps challenge that issue. Students having a difficult time formulating a concentration should think about the classes they have taken which they enjoyed the most and consider what topics they learned about in those courses. Also, topics covered in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GLOBAL%2045" title="GLOBAL 45" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GLOBAL 45');">GLOBAL 45</a></span> (GLOBAL N45, IAS 45, IAS N45), <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20100" title="POLECON 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON 100');">POLECON 100</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20101" title="POLECON 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON 101');">POLECON 101</a></span> are a good place to start.</p>

<p>Some sample concentration topics include, but most certainly are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Public Policy and Socioeconomic Inequality in the US</li>
	<li>Political Economy of China</li>
	<li>Environmental Policy in Post-Industrial Societies</li>
	<li>Resource Distribution and Development</li>
</ul>
<p>Departments and disciplines to consider when searching for concentration courses: Global Studies; Political Economy; Political Science; Economics; Sociology; Geography; History; Public Policy; Environmental Economics and Policy; Public Health; Gender and Women's Studies; Legal Studies; Environmental Science, Policy, and Management; and City and Regional Planning. Courses from these departments and disciplines are not guaranteed approval for a concentration, nor are students limited to the above list; this is just a good starting point. For a list of Pre-designed Political Economy concentrations, please visit the <a href="http://live-international-area-studies-academic-program.pantheon.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Political-Economy-Pre-designed-Concentrations-ES-9.11.17.pdf">Political Economy website.</a></p>
<p>To have a concentration approved, students must submit a two to four paragraph description of the particular issue they would like to study. Students must also submit a list of their four proposed courses along with a brief explanation (two to three sentences each) of how each course relates to their proposed concentration. Please use the form provided <a href="http://live-international-area-studies-academic-program.pantheon.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Pre-and-Self-Designed-Concentration-Approval-Form-Fillable-11.8.18.pdf" target="_blank">online</a>. Concentration proposals must be submitted in-person to a PE adviser along with the complete PE application. Students may be asked to provide syllabi for certain courses.</p>
<p>Please note that if an adviser determines a concentration proposal needs to be developed further, it will not be submitted for review by the Political Economy Faculty Committee until revisions have been made. For this reason, it is best not to delay speaking with a PE adviser about concentration topic ideas. concentration proposals are reviewed by the Political Economy Faculty Committee and students are notified by email if their concentration has been accepted or is being returned for revisions.</p>
<p>Any subsequent changes to already approved concentration topics and/or courses must be submitted to a PE advisor for review and approval by the Political Economy Faculty Committee prior to altering the concentration.</p>

The 21st century has seen powerful critiques of both growing economic inequality and the troubling persistence of domination based on gender, race and other categorical differences.

Insofar as capitalism is organized and distributes</span><span class="deschide"> power and profits through gendered structures, and gendered meanings and identities are shaped by their emergence within capitalist logics, it behooves us to think gender and capitalism in tandem.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Political Economy (PE) examines the relationship between politics and economics in modern societies and focuses on problems of both domestic and international policy. Based on the assumption that political-economic relationships are affected by any number of factors, such as society, culture, geography, and demographics, the curriculum is both multi and interdisciplinary in scope. The focus of the major is on contemporary issues, although a strong historical perspective is also emphasized. Students may also study planning and problem solving, environmental issues, resource distribution, and the challenges of institutional adaptation and changing political systems.</p>
<p>The major is designed to provide a broad-based liberal arts background as well as the intellectual skills appropriate for careers in either the public or private sector. Additionally, the major offers an excellent background for students planning postgraduate careers in social science disciplines or attending professional schools.</p>
<p>Some of the questions that the major addresses include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The tension between rising consumer demand and the need to minimize resource depletion and pollution.</li>
	<li>The different priorities served by a capitalist, socialist, and other varieties of political economy.</li>
	<li>The different priorities served by democratic, authoritarian, and other political systems.</li>
	<li>How international interdependence may undermine the efforts of national governments to cope with unemployment, inflation, trade and payment deficits, health, housing and welfare problems, and other socioeconomic issues.</li>
	<li>The importance of organizational structures for policy-making in both the public and private sectors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>

<h3><span>Honors Program</span></h3>
<p>To graduate with honors from the group major in PE, students must enroll in the two-semester honors seminar, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GLOBAL%20H102" title="GLOBAL H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GLOBAL H102');">GLOBAL H102</a></span> (fall only) and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span> (spring only) and must obtain a grade point average (GPA) of 3.6 in the major and 3.5 in overall University coursework. The honors seminar (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span>) is taken in addition to a student's regular course work for fulfilling requirements for the major and culminates in the writing of a senior thesis. To qualify for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span>, students must be recommended by the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GLOBAL%20H102" title="GLOBAL H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GLOBAL H102');">GLOBAL H102</a></span> instructor. The thesis is read by the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span> instructor and at least one other faculty member who is selected by the student in consultation with the thesis instructor. Eligibility for participating in the honors program is determined by the IAS office.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee that students accepted into the honors program will graduate with honors. Honors recommendations are made after graduation and are based on a number of factors including (but not limited to) major GPA, grades received for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GLOBAL%20H102" title="GLOBAL H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GLOBAL H102');">GLOBAL H102</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span>, and faculty adviser recommendations.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>

<h3>Foreign Language Requirement</h3>
<p>Political Economy (PE) majors must demonstrate proficiency in a modern language other than English by the last semester of their senior year. Proficiency is equivalent to the ability achieved in four college-level semesters (or two years). Language courses taken in high school do not satisfy this requirement. See below for details on how to fulfill the foreign language requirement.</p>
<p>Languages accepted by the College of Letters &amp; Science are not automatically accepted by the Political Economy program. Please check with a PE adviser for eligible languages.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to fulfill the four-semester language requirement for PE depending on the individual and his or her background and ability.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) test:</strong> An AP score of 5 or an International Baccalaureate (IB) score of 7 will complete this requirement. An AP score of 4 will place a student into the fourth-semester college-level course. A score of 3 will place a student into the third-semester college-level course. Documentation of AP scores must be provided.</li>
	<li><strong>Coursework: </strong>Any combination of college courses, summer programs, or college-level study abroad programs may satisfy the language requirement. Language classes are the only classes used to fulfill major requirements that may be taken for a letter grade or Pass/No Pass.  This includes the fourth semester. Language courses need not be taken at Berkeley. Courses taken at a community college or any accredited school or university may be acceptable. A one-semester upper division course taken abroad in the target language may satisfy the foreign language requirement, depending on the school and program followed. For more information, see a PE adviser concerning language study abroad.</li>
	<li><strong>Proficiency exam</strong>: Some, but not all, language departments on campus offer proficiency testing for students with advanced skills in that language. Please note that if a particular language is not taught on the UC Berkeley campus, then students are not able to test in that language. A student would then need to choose one of the other methods for fulfilling the foreign language requirement. Please speak with a PE adviser about proficiency testing.</li>
	<li><strong>High school completion in a non-English language</strong>: Students who were educated in a non-English language through the completion of high school or the equivalent may wish to satisfy this requirement with that experience. This requires a language proficiency exam. </li>
</ol>

<h3><span>Concentration</span></h3>
<p>The concentration is made up of four courses. Within the concentration, only two courses may be taken from the same department. Up to three courses taken abroad may count, provided they conform to the concentration topic; a syllabus in English must be provided.</p>
<p>The PE concentration is the theoretical focal point in the major. It is meant to give students the opportunity to deepen their understanding of political economy around an area of particular interest to them. The concentration is perhaps the greatest benefit of the Political Economy major because it allows students to apply the theoretical and methodological knowledge they have gained to a topic about which they feel particularly drawn or curious. Students spend four courses focusing on this material, so it is important for students to be thoughtful and develop a topic about which they enjoy learning.</p>
<p>To get started on the concentration, students should think about an existing or potential issue or question in political economy. Then they should choose four courses that will inform or increase their understanding about that issue. These courses should all relate to the topic as well as to one another. Students are encouraged to be imaginative in defining a concentration. A concentration issue is formulated by the student with the assistance of a PE advisor who can help to explain, clarify, or perhaps challenge that issue. Students having a difficult time formulating a concentration should think about the classes they have taken which they enjoyed the most and consider what topics they learned about in those courses. Also, topics covered in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GLOBAL%2045" title="GLOBAL 45" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GLOBAL 45');">GLOBAL 45</a></span> (GLOBAL N45, IAS 45, IAS N45), <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20100" title="POLECON 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON 100');">POLECON 100</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20101" title="POLECON 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON 101');">POLECON 101</a></span> are a good place to start.</p>

<p>Some sample concentration topics include, but most certainly are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Public Policy and Socioeconomic Inequality in the US</li>
	<li>Political Economy of China</li>
	<li>Environmental Policy in Post-Industrial Societies</li>
	<li>Resource Distribution and Development</li>
</ul>
<p>Departments and disciplines to consider when searching for concentration courses: Global Studies; Political Economy; Political Science; Economics; Sociology; Geography; History; Public Policy; Environmental Economics and Policy; Public Health; Gender and Women's Studies; Legal Studies; Environmental Science, Policy, and Management; and City and Regional Planning. Courses from these departments and disciplines are not guaranteed approval for a concentration, nor are students limited to the above list; this is just a good starting point. For a list of Pre-designed Political Economy concentrations, please visit the <a href="http://live-international-area-studies-academic-program.pantheon.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Political-Economy-Pre-designed-Concentrations-ES-9.11.17.pdf">Political Economy website.</a></p>
<p>To have a concentration approved, students must submit a two to four paragraph description of the particular issue they would like to study. Students must also submit a list of their four proposed courses along with a brief explanation (two to three sentences each) of how each course relates to their proposed concentration. Please use the form provided <a href="http://live-international-area-studies-academic-program.pantheon.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Pre-and-Self-Designed-Concentration-Approval-Form-Fillable-11.8.18.pdf" target="_blank">online</a>. Concentration proposals must be submitted in-person to a PE adviser along with the complete PE application. Students may be asked to provide syllabi for certain courses.</p>
<p>Please note that if an adviser determines a concentration proposal needs to be developed further, it will not be submitted for review by the Political Economy Faculty Committee until revisions have been made. For this reason, it is best not to delay speaking with a PE adviser about concentration topic ideas. concentration proposals are reviewed by the Political Economy Faculty Committee and students are notified by email if their concentration has been accepted or is being returned for revisions.</p>
<p>Any subsequent changes to already approved concentration topics and/or courses must be submitted to a PE advisor for review and approval by the Political Economy Faculty Committee prior to altering the concentration.</p>

<h3><strong>Political Economy Minor Rules and General Guidelines:</strong></h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li><span>All courses towards the minor must be upper division, at least three-semester units, and taken for a letter grade.</span></li>
	<li><span>No more than two courses may be taken from the same department.</span></li>
	<li><span>A minimum of three courses towards the minor must be taken at UC Berkeley.</span></li>
	<li><span>All transfer courses (e.g. Study Abroad) must be approved by a Political Economy minor advisor.</span></li>
	<li><span>POLECON 197, 198, and 199 cannot be used to fulfill minor requirements.</span></li>
	<li><span>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be achieved in all course work used to satisfy the minor requirements.</span></li>
	<li><span>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</span></li>
	<li><span>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement for Letters &amp; Science students.</span></li>
	<li><span>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which the student plans to graduate. Students who cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time should see an </span>advisor<span> in the College of Letters &amp; Science.</span></li>
	<li><span>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</span></li>

The 21st century has seen powerful critiques of both growing economic inequality and the troubling persistence of domination based on gender, race and other categorical differences. Gender has a distinctive role here for many reasons: the centrality of gender to social reproduction; the historical coproduction of male domination and capitalism; and the way gender operates in the constitution of selves. Insofar as capitalism is organized and distributes</span><span class="deschide"> power and profits through gendered structures, and gendered meanings and identities are shaped by their emergence within capitalist logics, it behooves us to think gender and capitalism in tandem.

<p>Political Economy (PE) examines the relationship between politics and economics in modern societies and focuses on problems of both domestic and international policy. Based on the assumption that political-economic relationships are affected by any number of factors, such as society, culture, geography, and demographics, the curriculum is both multi and interdisciplinary in scope. The focus of the major is on contemporary issues, although a strong historical perspective is also emphasized. Students may also study planning and problem solving, environmental issues, resource distribution, and the challenges of institutional adaptation and changing political systems.</p>
<p>The major is designed to provide a broad-based liberal arts background as well as the intellectual skills appropriate for careers in either the public or private sector. Additionally, the major offers an excellent background for students planning postgraduate careers in social science disciplines or attending professional schools.</p>
<p>Some of the questions that the major addresses include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The tension between rising consumer demand and the need to minimize resource depletion and pollution.</li>
	<li>The different priorities served by a capitalist, socialist, and other varieties of political economy.</li>
	<li>The different priorities served by democratic, authoritarian, and other political systems.</li>
	<li>How international interdependence may undermine the efforts of national governments to cope with unemployment, inflation, trade and payment deficits, health, housing and welfare problems, and other socioeconomic issues.</li>
	<li>The importance of organizational structures for policy-making in both the public and private sectors.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Foreign Language Requirement</h3>
<p>Political Economy (PE) majors must demonstrate proficiency in a modern language other than English by the last semester of their senior year. Proficiency is equivalent to the ability achieved in four college-level semesters (or two years). Language courses taken in high school do not satisfy this requirement. See below for details on how to fulfill the foreign language requirement.</p>
<p>Languages accepted by the College of Letters &amp; Science are not automatically accepted by the Political Economy program. Please check with a PE adviser for eligible languages.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to fulfill the four-semester language requirement for PE depending on the individual and his or her background and ability.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) test:</strong> An AP score of 5 or an International Baccalaureate (IB) score of 7 will complete this requirement. An AP score of 4 will place a student into the fourth-semester college-level course. A score of 3 will place a student into the third-semester college-level course. Documentation of AP scores must be provided.</li>
	<li><strong>Coursework: </strong>Any combination of college courses, summer programs, or college-level study abroad programs may satisfy the language requirement. Language classes are the only classes used to fulfill major requirements that may be taken for a letter grade or Pass/No Pass.  This includes the fourth semester. Language courses need not be taken at Berkeley. Courses taken at a community college or any accredited school or university may be acceptable. A one-semester upper division course taken abroad in the target language may satisfy the foreign language requirement, depending on the school and program followed. For more information, see a PE adviser concerning language study abroad.</li>
	<li><strong>Proficiency exam</strong>: Some, but not all, language departments on campus offer proficiency testing for students with advanced skills in that language. Please note that if a particular language is not taught on the UC Berkeley campus, then students are not able to test in that language. A student would then need to choose one of the other methods for fulfilling the foreign language requirement. Please speak with a PE adviser about proficiency testing.</li>
	<li><strong>High school completion in a non-English language</strong>: Students who were educated in a non-English language through the completion of high school or the equivalent may wish to satisfy this requirement with that experience. This requires a language proficiency exam. </li>
</ol>

<h3><span>Concentration</span></h3>
<p>The concentration is made up of four courses. Within the concentration, only two courses may be taken from the same department. Up to three courses taken abroad may count, provided they conform to the concentration topic; a syllabus in English must be provided.</p>
<p>The PE concentration is the theoretical focal point in the major. It is meant to give students the opportunity to deepen their understanding of political economy around an area of particular interest to them. The concentration is perhaps the greatest benefit of the Political Economy major because it allows students to apply the theoretical and methodological knowledge they have gained to a topic about which they feel particularly drawn or curious. Students spend four courses focusing on this material, so it is important for students to be thoughtful and develop a topic about which they enjoy learning.</p>
<p>To get started on the concentration, students should think about an existing or potential issue or question in political economy. Then they should choose four courses that will inform or increase their understanding about that issue. These courses should all relate to the topic as well as to one another. Students are encouraged to be imaginative in defining a concentration. A concentration issue is formulated by the student with the assistance of a PE advisor who can help to explain, clarify, or perhaps challenge that issue. Students having a difficult time formulating a concentration should think about the classes they have taken which they enjoyed the most and consider what topics they learned about in those courses. Also, topics covered in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GLOBAL%2045" title="GLOBAL 45" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GLOBAL 45');">GLOBAL 45</a></span> (GLOBAL N45, IAS 45, IAS N45), <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20100" title="POLECON 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON 100');">POLECON 100</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20101" title="POLECON 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON 101');">POLECON 101</a></span> are a good place to start.</p>

<p>Some sample concentration topics include, but most certainly are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Public Policy and Socioeconomic Inequality in the US</li>
	<li>Political Economy of China</li>
	<li>Environmental Policy in Post-Industrial Societies</li>
	<li>Resource Distribution and Development</li>
</ul>
<p>Departments and disciplines to consider when searching for concentration courses: Global Studies; Political Economy; Political Science; Economics; Sociology; Geography; History; Public Policy; Environmental Economics and Policy; Public Health; Gender and Women's Studies; Legal Studies; Environmental Science, Policy, and Management; and City and Regional Planning. Courses from these departments and disciplines are not guaranteed approval for a concentration, nor are students limited to the above list; this is just a good starting point. For a list of Pre-designed Political Economy concentrations, please visit the <a href="http://live-international-area-studies-academic-program.pantheon.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Political-Economy-Pre-designed-Concentrations-ES-9.11.17.pdf">Political Economy website.</a></p>
<p>To have a concentration approved, students must submit a two to four paragraph description of the particular issue they would like to study. Students must also submit a list of their four proposed courses along with a brief explanation (two to three sentences each) of how each course relates to their proposed concentration. Please use the form provided <a href="http://live-international-area-studies-academic-program.pantheon.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Pre-and-Self-Designed-Concentration-Approval-Form-Fillable-11.8.18.pdf" target="_blank">online</a>. Concentration proposals must be submitted in-person to a PE adviser along with the complete PE application. Students may be asked to provide syllabi for certain courses.</p>
<p>Please note that if an adviser determines a concentration proposal needs to be developed further, it will not be submitted for review by the Political Economy Faculty Committee until revisions have been made. For this reason, it is best not to delay speaking with a PE adviser about concentration topic ideas. concentration proposals are reviewed by the Political Economy Faculty Committee and students are notified by email if their concentration has been accepted or is being returned for revisions.</p>
<p>Any subsequent changes to already approved concentration topics and/or courses must be submitted to a PE advisor for review and approval by the Political Economy Faculty Committee prior to altering the concentration.</p>

The 21st century has seen powerful critiques of both growing economic inequality and the troubling persistence of domination based on gender, race and other categorical differences. Gender has a distinctive role here for many reasons: the centrality of gender to social reproduction; the historical coproduction of male domination and capitalism; and the way gender operates in the constitution of selves. Insofar as capitalism is organized and distributes</span><span class="deschide"> power and profits through gendered structures, and gendered meanings and identities are shaped by their emergence within capitalist logics, it behooves us to think gender and capitalism in tandem.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Political Economy (PE) examines the relationship between politics and economics in modern societies and focuses on problems of both domestic and international policy. Based on the assumption that political-economic relationships are affected by any number of factors, such as society, culture, geography, and demographics, the curriculum is both multi and interdisciplinary in scope. The focus of the major is on contemporary issues, although a strong historical perspective is also emphasized. Students may also study planning and problem solving, environmental issues, resource distribution, and the challenges of institutional adaptation and changing political systems.</p>
<p>The major is designed to provide a broad-based liberal arts background as well as the intellectual skills appropriate for careers in either the public or private sector. Additionally, the major offers an excellent background for students planning postgraduate careers in social science disciplines or attending professional schools.</p>
<p>Some of the questions that the major addresses include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The tension between rising consumer demand and the need to minimize resource depletion and pollution.</li>
	<li>The different priorities served by a capitalist, socialist, and other varieties of political economy.</li>
	<li>The different priorities served by democratic, authoritarian, and other political systems.</li>
	<li>How international interdependence may undermine the efforts of national governments to cope with unemployment, inflation, trade and payment deficits, health, housing and welfare problems, and other socioeconomic issues.</li>
	<li>The importance of organizational structures for policy-making in both the public and private sectors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>

<h3><span>Honors Program</span></h3>
<p>To graduate with honors from the group major in PE, students must enroll in the two-semester honors seminar, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GLOBAL%20H102" title="GLOBAL H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GLOBAL H102');">GLOBAL H102</a></span> (fall only) and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span> (spring only) and must obtain a grade point average (GPA) of 3.6 in the major and 3.5 in overall University coursework. The honors seminar (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span>) is taken in addition to a student's regular course work for fulfilling requirements for the major and culminates in the writing of a senior thesis. To qualify for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span>, students must be recommended by the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GLOBAL%20H102" title="GLOBAL H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GLOBAL H102');">GLOBAL H102</a></span> instructor. The thesis is read by the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span> instructor and at least one other faculty member who is selected by the student in consultation with the thesis instructor. Eligibility for participating in the honors program is determined by the IAS office.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee that students accepted into the honors program will graduate with honors. Honors recommendations are made after graduation and are based on a number of factors including (but not limited to) major GPA, grades received for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GLOBAL%20H102" title="GLOBAL H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GLOBAL H102');">GLOBAL H102</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span>, and faculty adviser recommendations.</p>

<h3>Foreign Language Requirement</h3>
<p>Political Economy (PE) majors must demonstrate proficiency in a modern language other than English by the last semester of their senior year. Proficiency is equivalent to the ability achieved in four college-level semesters (or two years). Language courses taken in high school do not satisfy this requirement. See below for details on how to fulfill the foreign language requirement.</p>
<p>Languages accepted by the College of Letters &amp; Science are not automatically accepted by the Political Economy program. Please check with a PE adviser for eligible languages.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to fulfill the four-semester language requirement for PE depending on the individual and his or her background and ability.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) test:</strong> An AP score of 5 or an International Baccalaureate (IB) score of 7 will complete this requirement. An AP score of 4 will place a student into the fourth-semester college-level course. A score of 3 will place a student into the third-semester college-level course. Documentation of AP scores must be provided.</li>
	<li><strong>Coursework: </strong>Any combination of college courses, summer programs, or college-level study abroad programs may satisfy the language requirement. Language classes are the only classes used to fulfill major requirements that may be taken for a letter grade or Pass/No Pass.  This includes the fourth semester. Language courses need not be taken at Berkeley. Courses taken at a community college or any accredited school or university may be acceptable. A one-semester upper division course taken abroad in the target language may satisfy the foreign language requirement, depending on the school and program followed. For more information, see a PE adviser concerning language study abroad.</li>
	<li><strong>Proficiency exam</strong>: Some, but not all, language departments on campus offer proficiency testing for students with advanced skills in that language. Please note that if a particular language is not taught on the UC Berkeley campus, then students are not able to test in that language. A student would then need to choose one of the other methods for fulfilling the foreign language requirement. Please speak with a PE adviser about proficiency testing.</li>
	<li><strong>High school completion in a non-English language</strong>: Students who were educated in a non-English language through the completion of high school or the equivalent may wish to satisfy this requirement with that experience. This requires a language proficiency exam. </li>
</ol>

<h3><span>Concentration</span></h3>
<p>The concentration is made up of four courses. Within the concentration, only two courses may be taken from the same department. Up to three courses taken abroad may count, provided they conform to the concentration topic; a syllabus in English must be provided.</p>
<p>The PE concentration is the theoretical focal point in the major. It is meant to give students the opportunity to deepen their understanding of political economy around an area of particular interest to them. The concentration is perhaps the greatest benefit of the Political Economy major because it allows students to apply the theoretical and methodological knowledge they have gained to a topic about which they feel particularly drawn or curious. Students spend four courses focusing on this material, so it is important for students to be thoughtful and develop a topic about which they enjoy learning.</p>
<p>To get started on the concentration, students should think about an existing or potential issue or question in political economy. Then they should choose four courses that will inform or increase their understanding about that issue. These courses should all relate to the topic as well as to one another. Students are encouraged to be imaginative in defining a concentration. A concentration issue is formulated by the student with the assistance of a PE advisor who can help to explain, clarify, or perhaps challenge that issue. Students having a difficult time formulating a concentration should think about the classes they have taken which they enjoyed the most and consider what topics they learned about in those courses. Also, topics covered in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GLOBAL%2045" title="GLOBAL 45" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GLOBAL 45');">GLOBAL 45</a></span> (GLOBAL N45, IAS 45, IAS N45), <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20100" title="POLECON 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON 100');">POLECON 100</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20101" title="POLECON 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON 101');">POLECON 101</a></span> are a good place to start.</p>

<p>Some sample concentration topics include, but most certainly are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Public Policy and Socioeconomic Inequality in the US</li>
	<li>Political Economy of China</li>
	<li>Environmental Policy in Post-Industrial Societies</li>
	<li>Resource Distribution and Development</li>
</ul>
<p>Departments and disciplines to consider when searching for concentration courses: Global Studies; Political Economy; Political Science; Economics; Sociology; Geography; History; Public Policy; Environmental Economics and Policy; Public Health; Gender and Women's Studies; Legal Studies; Environmental Science, Policy, and Management; and City and Regional Planning. Courses from these departments and disciplines are not guaranteed approval for a concentration, nor are students limited to the above list; this is just a good starting point. For a list of Pre-designed Political Economy concentrations, please visit the <a href="http://live-international-area-studies-academic-program.pantheon.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Political-Economy-Pre-designed-Concentrations-ES-9.11.17.pdf">Political Economy website.</a></p>
<p>To have a concentration approved, students must submit a two to four paragraph description of the particular issue they would like to study. Students must also submit a list of their four proposed courses along with a brief explanation (two to three sentences each) of how each course relates to their proposed concentration. Please use the form provided <a href="http://live-international-area-studies-academic-program.pantheon.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Pre-and-Self-Designed-Concentration-Approval-Form-Fillable-11.8.18.pdf" target="_blank">online</a>. Concentration proposals must be submitted in-person to a PE adviser along with the complete PE application. Students may be asked to provide syllabi for certain courses.</p>
<p>Please note that if an adviser determines a concentration proposal needs to be developed further, it will not be submitted for review by the Political Economy Faculty Committee until revisions have been made. For this reason, it is best not to delay speaking with a PE adviser about concentration topic ideas. concentration proposals are reviewed by the Political Economy Faculty Committee and students are notified by email if their concentration has been accepted or is being returned for revisions.</p>
<p>Any subsequent changes to already approved concentration topics and/or courses must be submitted to a PE advisor for review and approval by the Political Economy Faculty Committee prior to altering the concentration.</p>

The 21st century has seen powerful critiques of both growing economic inequality and the troubling persistence of domination based on gender, race and other categorical differences. Gender has a distinctive role here for many reasons: the centrality of gender to social reproduction; the historical coproduction of male domination and capitalism; and the way gender operates in the constitution of selves. Insofar as capitalism is organized and distributes</span><span class="deschide"> power and profits through gendered structures, and gendered meanings and identities are shaped by their emergence within capitalist logics, it behooves us to think gender and capitalism in tandem.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Political Economy (PE) examines the relationship between politics and economics in modern societies and focuses on problems of both domestic and international policy. Based on the assumption that political-economic relationships are affected by any number of factors, such as society, culture, geography, and demographics, the curriculum is both multi and interdisciplinary in scope. The focus of the major is on contemporary issues, although a strong historical perspective is also emphasized. Students may also study planning and problem solving, environmental issues, resource distribution, and the challenges of institutional adaptation and changing political systems.</p>
<p>The major is designed to provide a broad-based liberal arts background as well as the intellectual skills appropriate for careers in either the public or private sector. Additionally, the major offers an excellent background for students planning postgraduate careers in social science disciplines or attending professional schools.</p>
<p>Some of the questions that the major addresses include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The tension between rising consumer demand and the need to minimize resource depletion and pollution.</li>
	<li>The different priorities served by a capitalist, socialist, and other varieties of political economy.</li>
	<li>The different priorities served by democratic, authoritarian, and other political systems.</li>
	<li>How international interdependence may undermine the efforts of national governments to cope with unemployment, inflation, trade and payment deficits, health, housing and welfare problems, and other socioeconomic issues.</li>
	<li>The importance of organizational structures for policy-making in both the public and private sectors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>

<h3><span>Honors Program</span></h3>
<p>To graduate with honors from the group major in PE, students must enroll in the two-semester honors seminar, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GLOBAL%20H102" title="GLOBAL H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GLOBAL H102');">GLOBAL H102</a></span> (fall only) and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span> (spring only) and must obtain a grade point average (GPA) of 3.6 in the major and 3.5 in overall University coursework. The honors seminar (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span>) is taken in addition to a student's regular course work for fulfilling requirements for the major and culminates in the writing of a senior thesis. To qualify for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span>, students must be recommended by the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GLOBAL%20H102" title="GLOBAL H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GLOBAL H102');">GLOBAL H102</a></span> instructor. The thesis is read by the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span> instructor and at least one other faculty member who is selected by the student in consultation with the thesis instructor. Eligibility for participating in the honors program is determined by the IAS office.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee that students accepted into the honors program will graduate with honors. Honors recommendations are made after graduation and are based on a number of factors including (but not limited to) major GPA, grades received for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GLOBAL%20H102" title="GLOBAL H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GLOBAL H102');">GLOBAL H102</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20H195" title="POLECON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON H195');">POLECON H195</a></span>, and faculty adviser recommendations.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>

<h3>Foreign Language Requirement</h3>
<p>Political Economy (PE) majors must demonstrate proficiency in a modern language other than English by the last semester of their senior year. Proficiency is equivalent to the ability achieved in four college-level semesters (or two years). Language courses taken in high school do not satisfy this requirement. See below for details on how to fulfill the foreign language requirement.</p>
<p>Languages accepted by the College of Letters &amp; Science are not automatically accepted by the Political Economy program. Please check with a PE adviser for eligible languages.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to fulfill the four-semester language requirement for PE depending on the individual and his or her background and ability.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) test:</strong> An AP score of 5 or an International Baccalaureate (IB) score of 7 will complete this requirement. An AP score of 4 will place a student into the fourth-semester college-level course. A score of 3 will place a student into the third-semester college-level course. Documentation of AP scores must be provided.</li>
	<li><strong>Coursework: </strong>Any combination of college courses, summer programs, or college-level study abroad programs may satisfy the language requirement. Language classes are the only classes used to fulfill major requirements that may be taken for a letter grade or Pass/No Pass.  This includes the fourth semester. Language courses need not be taken at Berkeley. Courses taken at a community college or any accredited school or university may be acceptable. A one-semester upper division course taken abroad in the target language may satisfy the foreign language requirement, depending on the school and program followed. For more information, see a PE adviser concerning language study abroad.</li>
	<li><strong>Proficiency exam</strong>: Some, but not all, language departments on campus offer proficiency testing for students with advanced skills in that language. Please note that if a particular language is not taught on the UC Berkeley campus, then students are not able to test in that language. A student would then need to choose one of the other methods for fulfilling the foreign language requirement. Please speak with a PE adviser about proficiency testing.</li>
	<li><strong>High school completion in a non-English language</strong>: Students who were educated in a non-English language through the completion of high school or the equivalent may wish to satisfy this requirement with that experience. This requires a language proficiency exam. </li>
</ol>

<h3><span>Concentration</span></h3>
<p>The concentration is made up of four courses. Within the concentration, only two courses may be taken from the same department. Up to three courses taken abroad may count, provided they conform to the concentration topic; a syllabus in English must be provided.</p>
<p>The PE concentration is the theoretical focal point in the major. It is meant to give students the opportunity to deepen their understanding of political economy around an area of particular interest to them. The concentration is perhaps the greatest benefit of the Political Economy major because it allows students to apply the theoretical and methodological knowledge they have gained to a topic about which they feel particularly drawn or curious. Students spend four courses focusing on this material, so it is important for students to be thoughtful and develop a topic about which they enjoy learning.</p>
<p>To get started on the concentration, students should think about an existing or potential issue or question in political economy. Then they should choose four courses that will inform or increase their understanding about that issue. These courses should all relate to the topic as well as to one another. Students are encouraged to be imaginative in defining a concentration. A concentration issue is formulated by the student with the assistance of a PE advisor who can help to explain, clarify, or perhaps challenge that issue. Students having a difficult time formulating a concentration should think about the classes they have taken which they enjoyed the most and consider what topics they learned about in those courses. Also, topics covered in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GLOBAL%2045" title="GLOBAL 45" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GLOBAL 45');">GLOBAL 45</a></span> (GLOBAL N45, IAS 45, IAS N45), <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20100" title="POLECON 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON 100');">POLECON 100</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POLECON%20101" title="POLECON 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POLECON 101');">POLECON 101</a></span> are a good place to start.</p>

<p>Some sample concentration topics include, but most certainly are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Public Policy and Socioeconomic Inequality in the US</li>
	<li>Political Economy of China</li>
	<li>Environmental Policy in Post-Industrial Societies</li>
	<li>Resource Distribution and Development</li>
</ul>
<p>Departments and disciplines to consider when searching for concentration courses: Global Studies; Political Economy; Political Science; Economics; Sociology; Geography; History; Public Policy; Environmental Economics and Policy; Public Health; Gender and Women's Studies; Legal Studies; Environmental Science, Policy, and Management; and City and Regional Planning. Courses from these departments and disciplines are not guaranteed approval for a concentration, nor are students limited to the above list; this is just a good starting point. For a list of Pre-designed Political Economy concentrations, please visit the <a href="http://live-international-area-studies-academic-program.pantheon.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Political-Economy-Pre-designed-Concentrations-ES-9.11.17.pdf">Political Economy website.</a></p>
<p>To have a concentration approved, students must submit a two to four paragraph description of the particular issue they would like to study. Students must also submit a list of their four proposed courses along with a brief explanation (two to three sentences each) of how each course relates to their proposed concentration. Please use the form provided <a href="http://live-international-area-studies-academic-program.pantheon.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Pre-and-Self-Designed-Concentration-Approval-Form-Fillable-11.8.18.pdf" target="_blank">online</a>. Concentration proposals must be submitted in-person to a PE adviser along with the complete PE application. Students may be asked to provide syllabi for certain courses.</p>
<p>Please note that if an adviser determines a concentration proposal needs to be developed further, it will not be submitted for review by the Political Economy Faculty Committee until revisions have been made. For this reason, it is best not to delay speaking with a PE adviser about concentration topic ideas. concentration proposals are reviewed by the Political Economy Faculty Committee and students are notified by email if their concentration has been accepted or is being returned for revisions.</p>
<p>Any subsequent changes to already approved concentration topics and/or courses must be submitted to a PE advisor for review and approval by the Political Economy Faculty Committee prior to altering the concentration.</p>

<h3><strong>Political Economy Minor Rules and General Guidelines:</strong></h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li><span>All courses towards the minor must be upper division, at least three-semester units, and taken for a letter grade.</span></li>
	<li><span>No more than two courses may be taken from the same department.</span></li>
	<li><span>A minimum of three courses towards the minor must be taken at UC Berkeley.</span></li>
	<li><span>All transfer courses (e.g. Study Abroad) must be approved by a Political Economy minor advisor.</span></li>
	<li><span>POLECON 197, 198, and 199 cannot be used to fulfill minor requirements.</span></li>
	<li><span>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be achieved in all course work used to satisfy the minor requirements.</span></li>
	<li><span>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</span></li>
	<li><span>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement for Letters &amp; Science students.</span></li>
	<li><span>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which the student plans to graduate. Students who cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time should see an </span>advisor<span> in the College of Letters &amp; Science.</span></li>
	<li><span>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</span></li>

The 21st century has seen powerful critiques of both growing economic inequality and the troubling persistence of domination based on gender, race and other categorical differences. Gender has a distinctive role here for many reasons: the centrality of gender to social reproduction; the historical coproduction of male domination and capitalism; and the way gender operates in the constitution of selves. Insofar as capitalism is organized and distributes</span><span class="deschide"> power and profits through gendered structures, and gendered meanings and identities are shaped by their emergence within capitalist logics, it behooves us to think gender and capitalism in tandem.
