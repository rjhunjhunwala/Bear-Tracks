				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Within the Dance and Performance Studies curriculum, we understand performance to be a mode of critical inquiry and research, a means of creative expression, and a vehicle for public engagement. We engage with dance on physical, intellectual, and aesthetic levels. It is our hope that dancers not only grow as performers, but also as artists, thinkers, makers, viewers, and participants. The practical focus of the major is on the performance and choreography of contemporary dance and dance theater. Of equal importance is the study of theater and dance theory, history, culture, and literature.</p>
<p>The dance training and academic courses offered by our department are rigorous and geared toward the student who is interested in learning about dance and performance from multiple perspectives. As either a major or minor in Dance and Performance Studies, you will study with faculty known nationally and internationally for their scholarly research and creative work. Many of our graduates have careers in professional dance companies. Other students have gone on to graduate study in a wide variety of arts-related fields and have developed careers in universities, non-profits, and professional fields in health care, education, and business.</p>
<p>The opportunities in our department are many and varied. They include regular student-led performances, an annual spring concert series where students perform in faculty and guest-artist repertory pieces, the option to participate in an honors thesis/project, and exposure to a myriad of diverse and exciting lectures, speakers, guest artists, and performances.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>For further information regarding the prerequisites for declaring the major, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Majors in the Department of Dance and Performance Studies with an overall GPA of 3.3 in the University may, with the approval of the department, apply to complete an honors project. There are two types of honors projects:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Written-Only Thesis</li>
	<li>Written Honors Essay and Production</li>
</ol>
<p>Students should apply through the Undergraduate Academic Adviser and can find more detailed information on the TDPS website. </p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies (TDPS) offers a minor in Dance and Performance Studies. For further information regarding the minor requirements, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>Confirm your intention to minor after enrolling in 1 course in the department. Transfer students can discuss coursework transfers into the minor, as well as dance level placement, with the Undergraduate Academic Adviser. Since your minor will be from the Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies, it is likely you will do most of your minor coursework here.</p>

	<li><span><strong>Transfer Units: </strong>It is rare that Community College coursework will transfer into the Dance and Performance Studies Minor because they are lower division.

Since your minor will be from this department, it is likely you will do most of your minor coursework here. If you have a question about coursework transfer into the minor, bring unofficial transcripts and course descriptions to the Undergraduate Academic Advisor.</span></li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Department of Theater, Dance and Performance Studies (TDPS) teaches performance as a mode of critical inquiry, creative expression and public engagement. Through performance training and research, the department creates liberal arts graduates with expanded analytical, technical and imaginative capacities. As a public institution, diversity and inclusion is a key part of teaching, art making, and public programming.</p>
<p>Undergraduate majors and minors are well prepared for the future, both as artists and engaged citizens of the world. At a time when scholars and practitioners across a variety of fields call for more cross-disciplinary intellectual collaboration and project-based learning in higher education, the department takes pride in its daily commitment to collaboration and to the kind of rigorously critical, team-based projects the department develops with its students, staff, and faculty both in the classroom and in its production season.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>By the end of their time in D&amp;PS, beyond TDPS goals, students should possess the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal, written form.</li>
	<li>Proficiency in research methods (i.e., utilization of public and private archives, libraries, electronic databases, oral histories; textual and performance analysis).</li>
	<li>Collaborative skills.</li>
	<li>Foundational stagecraft and production skills and knowledge (e.g., design, craft and technology, stage management, and new media).</li>
	<li>Literacy in foundational dramatic texts and fundamental concepts of performance theory.</li>
	<li>Basic history of Euro-American dance practice, including issues of race, ethnicity, and multiculturalism in the performing arts.</li>
	<li>Basic modern/contemporary dance technique in the Western concert dance tradition.</li>
	<li>Understanding of the choreographic process and the tools necessary for this process.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Through upper division course work, electives, and capstone experiences students should also possess advanced training in at least one of the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Choreography.</li>
	<li>Advanced Dance Technique.</li>
	<li>History &amp; Theory of Dance.</li>

How might we characterize California? Who lives here &amp; what are the stories we tell about them? This course takes California as the site through which to explore how cultural systems of performance help shape social systems of race, considering the role performance forms–theater, film, tourism, pageants, political protests–have played in shaping California’s unique cultural and racial topography. From the theatricalization</span><span class="deschide"> of Chinatown in Rodgers’ and Hammerstein’s Flower Drum Song to that of urban riots in Twilight, from the staging of Latinx farmworker’s rights to those of post-war African American workers of the Great Migration, performance strategies have been used by a variety of agents towards a range of social &amp; political goals.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Within the Dance and Performance Studies curriculum, we understand performance to be a mode of critical inquiry and research, a means of creative expression, and a vehicle for public engagement. We engage with dance on physical, intellectual, and aesthetic levels. It is our hope that dancers not only grow as performers, but also as artists, thinkers, makers, viewers, and participants. The practical focus of the major is on the performance and choreography of contemporary dance and dance theater. Of equal importance is the study of theater and dance theory, history, culture, and literature.</p>
<p>The dance training and academic courses offered by our department are rigorous and geared toward the student who is interested in learning about dance and performance from multiple perspectives. As either a major or minor in Dance and Performance Studies, you will study with faculty known nationally and internationally for their scholarly research and creative work. Many of our graduates have careers in professional dance companies. Other students have gone on to graduate study in a wide variety of arts-related fields and have developed careers in universities, non-profits, and professional fields in health care, education, and business.</p>
<p>The opportunities in our department are many and varied. They include regular student-led performances, an annual spring concert series where students perform in faculty and guest-artist repertory pieces, the option to participate in an honors thesis/project, and exposure to a myriad of diverse and exciting lectures, speakers, guest artists, and performances.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>For further information regarding the prerequisites for declaring the major, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Majors in the Department of Dance and Performance Studies with an overall GPA of 3.3 in the University may, with the approval of the department, apply to complete an honors project. There are two types of honors projects:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Written-Only Thesis</li>
	<li>Written Honors Essay and Production</li>
</ol>
<p>Students should apply through the Undergraduate Academic Adviser and can find more detailed information on the TDPS website. </p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies (TDPS) offers a minor in Dance and Performance Studies. For further information regarding the minor requirements, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>Confirm your intention to minor after enrolling in 1 course in the department. Transfer students can discuss coursework transfers into the minor, as well as dance level placement, with the Undergraduate Academic Adviser. Since your minor will be from the Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies, it is likely you will do most of your minor coursework here.</p>

	<li><span><strong>Transfer Units: </strong>It is rare that Community College coursework will transfer into the Dance and Performance Studies Minor because they are lower division. If you have a strong dance background, continue your dance training in the department at the appropriate level. Audition for that course on the first day of class and enroll after being admitted. Since your minor will be from this department, it is likely you will do most of your minor coursework here. If you have a question about coursework transfer into the minor, bring unofficial transcripts and course descriptions to the Undergraduate Academic Advisor.</span></li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Department of Theater, Dance and Performance Studies (TDPS) teaches performance as a mode of critical inquiry, creative expression and public engagement. Through performance training and research, the department creates liberal arts graduates with expanded analytical, technical and imaginative capacities. As a public institution, diversity and inclusion is a key part of teaching, art making, and public programming.</p>
<p>Undergraduate majors and minors are well prepared for the future, both as artists and engaged citizens of the world. At a time when scholars and practitioners across a variety of fields call for more cross-disciplinary intellectual collaboration and project-based learning in higher education, the department takes pride in its daily commitment to collaboration and to the kind of rigorously critical, team-based projects the department develops with its students, staff, and faculty both in the classroom and in its production season.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>By the end of their time in D&amp;PS, beyond TDPS goals, students should possess the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal, written form.</li>
	<li>Proficiency in research methods (i.e., utilization of public and private archives, libraries, electronic databases, oral histories; textual and performance analysis).</li>
	<li>Collaborative skills.</li>
	<li>Foundational stagecraft and production skills and knowledge (e.g., design, craft and technology, stage management, and new media).</li>
	<li>Literacy in foundational dramatic texts and fundamental concepts of performance theory.</li>
	<li>Basic history of Euro-American dance practice, including issues of race, ethnicity, and multiculturalism in the performing arts.</li>
	<li>Basic modern/contemporary dance technique in the Western concert dance tradition.</li>
	<li>Understanding of the choreographic process and the tools necessary for this process.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Through upper division course work, electives, and capstone experiences students should also possess advanced training in at least one of the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Choreography.</li>
	<li>Advanced Dance Technique.</li>
	<li>History &amp; Theory of Dance.</li>

How might we characterize California? Who lives here &amp; what are the stories we tell about them? This course takes California as the site through which to explore how cultural systems of performance help shape social systems of race, considering the role performance forms–theater, film, tourism, pageants, political protests–have played in shaping California’s unique cultural and racial topography. From the theatricalization</span><span class="deschide"> of Chinatown in Rodgers’ and Hammerstein’s Flower Drum Song to that of urban riots in Twilight, from the staging of Latinx farmworker’s rights to those of post-war African American workers of the Great Migration, performance strategies have been used by a variety of agents towards a range of social &amp; political goals.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Within the Dance and Performance Studies curriculum, we understand performance to be a mode of critical inquiry and research, a means of creative expression, and a vehicle for public engagement. We engage with dance on physical, intellectual, and aesthetic levels. It is our hope that dancers not only grow as performers, but also as artists, thinkers, makers, viewers, and participants. The practical focus of the major is on the performance and choreography of contemporary dance and dance theater. Of equal importance is the study of theater and dance theory, history, culture, and literature.</p>
<p>The dance training and academic courses offered by our department are rigorous and geared toward the student who is interested in learning about dance and performance from multiple perspectives. As either a major or minor in Dance and Performance Studies, you will study with faculty known nationally and internationally for their scholarly research and creative work. Many of our graduates have careers in professional dance companies. Other students have gone on to graduate study in a wide variety of arts-related fields and have developed careers in universities, non-profits, and professional fields in health care, education, and business.</p>
<p>The opportunities in our department are many and varied. They include regular student-led performances, an annual spring concert series where students perform in faculty and guest-artist repertory pieces, the option to participate in an honors thesis/project, and exposure to a myriad of diverse and exciting lectures, speakers, guest artists, and performances.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>For further information regarding the prerequisites for declaring the major, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Majors in the Department of Dance and Performance Studies with an overall GPA of 3.3 in the University may, with the approval of the department, apply to complete an honors project. There are two types of honors projects:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Written-Only Thesis</li>
	<li>Written Honors Essay and Production</li>
</ol>
<p>Students should apply through the Undergraduate Academic Adviser and can find more detailed information on the TDPS website. </p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies (TDPS) offers a minor in Dance and Performance Studies. For further information regarding the minor requirements, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>Confirm your intention to minor after enrolling in 1 course in the department. Transfer students can discuss coursework transfers into the minor, as well as dance level placement, with the Undergraduate Academic Adviser. Since your minor will be from the Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies, it is likely you will do most of your minor coursework here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:5.0pt">A maximum of 8 units of equivalent upper division coursework transfer into the major from education abroad programs, other UCB departments, or other 4-year colleges as electives upon departmental approval. All L&amp;S-approved units from other colleges transfer into your BA degree, but rarely into the Dance and Performance Studies major. We remind transfer students to bring a copy of previous transcripts/course descriptions to Undergraduate Academic Advisor for evaluation. </p>

</li>

	<li><span>If a student is not admitted to an upper division Dance Technique course or chooses not to take one, they then must take four upper-division elective courses, instead of three courses. </span></li>
	<li><span>A course with the identical course number may only be counted twice toward the minor and only if they have different focus topics. Only two courses may be repeated in this way.

</li>

	<li><span><strong>Transfer Units: </strong>It is rare that Community College coursework will transfer into the Dance and Performance Studies Minor because they are lower division. If you have a strong dance background, continue your dance training in the department at the appropriate level. Audition for that course on the first day of class and enroll after being admitted. Since your minor will be from this department, it is likely you will do most of your minor coursework here. If you have a question about coursework transfer into the minor, bring unofficial transcripts and course descriptions to the Undergraduate Academic Advisor.</span></li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Department of Theater, Dance and Performance Studies (TDPS) teaches performance as a mode of critical inquiry, creative expression and public engagement. Through performance training and research, the department creates liberal arts graduates with expanded analytical, technical and imaginative capacities. As a public institution, diversity and inclusion is a key part of teaching, art making, and public programming.</p>
<p>Undergraduate majors and minors are well prepared for the future, both as artists and engaged citizens of the world. At a time when scholars and practitioners across a variety of fields call for more cross-disciplinary intellectual collaboration and project-based learning in higher education, the department takes pride in its daily commitment to collaboration and to the kind of rigorously critical, team-based projects the department develops with its students, staff, and faculty both in the classroom and in its production season.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>By the end of their time in D&amp;PS, beyond TDPS goals, students should possess the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal, written form.</li>
	<li>Proficiency in research methods (i.e., utilization of public and private archives, libraries, electronic databases, oral histories; textual and performance analysis).</li>
	<li>Collaborative skills.</li>
	<li>Foundational stagecraft and production skills and knowledge (e.g., design, craft and technology, stage management, and new media).</li>
	<li>Literacy in foundational dramatic texts and fundamental concepts of performance theory.</li>
	<li>Basic history of Euro-American dance practice, including issues of race, ethnicity, and multiculturalism in the performing arts.</li>
	<li>Basic modern/contemporary dance technique in the Western concert dance tradition.</li>
	<li>Understanding of the choreographic process and the tools necessary for this process.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Through upper division course work, electives, and capstone experiences students should also possess advanced training in at least one of the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Choreography.</li>
	<li>Advanced Dance Technique.</li>
	<li>History &amp; Theory of Dance.</li>
</ol>

How might we characterize California? Who lives here &amp; what are the stories we tell about them? This course takes California as the site through which to explore how cultural systems of performance help shape social systems of race, considering the role performance forms–theater, film, tourism, pageants, political protests–have played in shaping California’s unique cultural and racial topography. From the theatricalization</span><span class="deschide"> of Chinatown in Rodgers’ and Hammerstein’s Flower Drum Song to that of urban riots in Twilight, from the staging of Latinx farmworker’s rights to those of post-war African American workers of the Great Migration, performance strategies have been used by a variety of agents towards a range of social &amp; political goals.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Within the Dance and Performance Studies curriculum, we understand performance to be a mode of critical inquiry and research, a means of creative expression, and a vehicle for public engagement. We engage with dance on physical, intellectual, and aesthetic levels. It is our hope that dancers not only grow as performers, but also as artists, thinkers, makers, viewers, and participants. The practical focus of the major is on the performance and choreography of contemporary dance and dance theater. Of equal importance is the study of theater and dance theory, history, culture, and literature.</p>
<p>The dance training and academic courses offered by our department are rigorous and geared toward the student who is interested in learning about dance and performance from multiple perspectives. As either a major or minor in Dance and Performance Studies, you will study with faculty known nationally and internationally for their scholarly research and creative work. Many of our graduates have careers in professional dance companies. Other students have gone on to graduate study in a wide variety of arts-related fields and have developed careers in universities, non-profits, and professional fields in health care, education, and business.</p>
<p>The opportunities in our department are many and varied. They include regular student-led performances, an annual spring concert series where students perform in faculty and guest-artist repertory pieces, the option to participate in an honors thesis/project, and exposure to a myriad of diverse and exciting lectures, speakers, guest artists, and performances.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>For further information regarding the prerequisites for declaring the major, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Majors in the Department of Dance and Performance Studies with an overall GPA of 3.3 in the University may, with the approval of the department, apply to complete an honors project. There are two types of honors projects:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Written-Only Thesis</li>
	<li>Written Honors Essay and Production</li>
</ol>
<p>Students should apply through the Undergraduate Academic Adviser and can find more detailed information on the TDPS website. </p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies (TDPS) offers a minor in Dance and Performance Studies. For further information regarding the minor requirements, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>Confirm your intention to minor after enrolling in 1 course in the department. Transfer students can discuss coursework transfers into the minor, as well as dance level placement, with the Undergraduate Academic Adviser. Since your minor will be from the Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies, it is likely you will do most of your minor coursework here.</p>

</li>

	<li><span>If a student is not admitted to an upper division Dance Technique course or chooses not to take one, they then must take four upper-division elective courses, instead of three courses. </span></li>
	<li><span>A course with the identical course number may only be counted twice toward the minor and only if they have different focus topics. Only two courses may be repeated in this way.

</li>

	<li><span><strong>Transfer Units: </strong>It is rare that Community College coursework will transfer into the Dance and Performance Studies Minor because they are lower division. If you have a strong dance background, continue your dance training in the department at the appropriate level. Audition for that course on the first day of class and enroll after being admitted. Since your minor will be from this department, it is likely you will do most of your minor coursework here. If you have a question about coursework transfer into the minor, bring unofficial transcripts and course descriptions to the Undergraduate Academic Advisor.</span></li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Department of Theater, Dance and Performance Studies (TDPS) teaches performance as a mode of critical inquiry, creative expression and public engagement. Through performance training and research, the department creates liberal arts graduates with expanded analytical, technical and imaginative capacities. As a public institution, diversity and inclusion is a key part of teaching, art making, and public programming.</p>
<p>Undergraduate majors and minors are well prepared for the future, both as artists and engaged citizens of the world. At a time when scholars and practitioners across a variety of fields call for more cross-disciplinary intellectual collaboration and project-based learning in higher education, the department takes pride in its daily commitment to collaboration and to the kind of rigorously critical, team-based projects the department develops with its students, staff, and faculty both in the classroom and in its production season.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>By the end of their time in D&amp;PS, beyond TDPS goals, students should possess the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal, written form.</li>

	<li>Collaborative skills.</li>
	<li>Foundational stagecraft and production skills and knowledge (e.g., design, craft and technology, stage management, and new media).</li>
	<li>Literacy in foundational dramatic texts and fundamental concepts of performance theory.</li>
	<li>Basic history of Euro-American dance practice, including issues of race, ethnicity, and multiculturalism in the performing arts.</li>
	<li>Basic modern/contemporary dance technique in the Western concert dance tradition.</li>
	<li>Understanding of the choreographic process and the tools necessary for this process.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Through upper division course work, electives, and capstone experiences students should also possess advanced training in at least one of the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Choreography.</li>
	<li>Advanced Dance Technique.</li>
	<li>History &amp; Theory of Dance.</li>
</ol>

Fundamentals of Acting I (Theater 10) is the entry level course for the acting sequence and focuses on releasing and cultivating the actor’s inherent creativity. Through exercises, improvisation, scenes, and monologues, the actor begins to develop basic techniques designed to stimulate the imagination, develop vocal and physical ability, increase awareness of self and others, introduce effective ways to analyze texts,</span><span class="deschide"> think critically about the craft of acting, and enhance self-confidence and communication skills. This class is the essential beginning of the actor’s studies, which will ultimately allow her or him to effectively engage and explore work from a rich diversity of genres, styles, and backgrounds.</span><br/>

This is a project-based class in collaborative innovation where students experience group creativity and team-based design by using techniques from across the disciplines of business, theatre, design, and art practice. They will leverage problem framing and solving techniques derived from critical thinking, systems thinking, and creative problem solving (popularly known today as design thinking). The course is grounded in a brief weekly lecture</span><span class="deschide"> that sets out the theoretical, historical, and cultural contexts for particular innovation practices, but the majority of the class involves hands-on studio-based learning guided by an interdisciplinary team of teachers leading small group collaborative projects.<br/></span><br/>

How might we characterize California? Who lives here &amp; what are the stories we tell about them? This course takes California as the site through which to explore how cultural systems of performance help shape social systems of race, considering the role performance forms–theater, film, tourism, pageants, political protests–have played in shaping California’s unique cultural and racial topography. From the theatricalization</span><span class="deschide"> of Chinatown in Rodgers’ and Hammerstein’s Flower Drum Song to that of urban riots in Twilight, from the staging of Latinx farmworker’s rights to those of post-war African American workers of the Great Migration, performance strategies have been used by a variety of agents towards a range of social &amp; political goals.</span><br/>

<p>Within the Dance and Performance Studies curriculum, we understand performance to be a mode of critical inquiry and research, a means of creative expression, and a vehicle for public engagement. We engage with dance on physical, intellectual, and aesthetic levels. It is our hope that dancers not only grow as performers, but also as artists, thinkers, makers, viewers, and participants. The practical focus of the major is on the performance and choreography of contemporary dance and dance theater. Of equal importance is the study of theater and dance theory, history, culture, and literature.</p>
<p>The dance training and academic courses offered by our department are rigorous and geared toward the student who is interested in learning about dance and performance from multiple perspectives. As either a major or minor in Dance and Performance Studies, you will study with faculty known nationally and internationally for their scholarly research and creative work. Many of our graduates have careers in professional dance companies. Other students have gone on to graduate study in a wide variety of arts-related fields and have developed careers in universities, non-profits, and professional fields in health care, education, and business.</p>
<p>The opportunities in our department are many and varied. They include regular student-led performances, an annual spring concert series where students perform in faculty and guest-artist repertory pieces, the option to participate in an honors thesis/project, and exposure to a myriad of diverse and exciting lectures, speakers, guest artists, and performances.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>For further information regarding the prerequisites for declaring the major, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Majors in the Department of Dance and Performance Studies with an overall GPA of 3.3 in the University may, with the approval of the department, apply to complete an honors project. There are two types of honors projects:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Written-Only Thesis</li>
	<li>Written Honors Essay and Production</li>
</ol>
<p>Students should apply through the Undergraduate Academic Adviser and can find more detailed information on the TDPS website. </p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies (TDPS) offers a minor in Dance and Performance Studies. For further information regarding the minor requirements, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>Confirm your intention to minor after enrolling in 1 course in the department. Transfer students can discuss coursework transfers into the minor, as well as dance level placement, with the Undergraduate Academic Adviser. Since your minor will be from the Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies, it is likely you will do most of your minor coursework here.</p>

	<li><span><strong>Transfer Units: </strong>It is rare that Community College coursework will transfer into the Dance and Performance Studies Minor because they are lower division. If you have a strong dance background, continue your dance training in the department at the appropriate level. Audition for that course on the first day of class and enroll after being admitted. Since your minor will be from this department, it is likely you will do most of your minor coursework here. If you have a question about coursework transfer into the minor, bring unofficial transcripts and course descriptions to the Undergraduate Academic Advisor.</span></li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Department of Theater, Dance and Performance Studies (TDPS) teaches performance as a mode of critical inquiry, creative expression and public engagement. Through performance training and research, the department creates liberal arts graduates with expanded analytical, technical and imaginative capacities. As a public institution, diversity and inclusion is a key part of teaching, art making, and public programming.</p>
<p>Undergraduate majors and minors are well prepared for the future, both as artists and engaged citizens of the world. At a time when scholars and practitioners across a variety of fields call for more cross-disciplinary intellectual collaboration and project-based learning in higher education, the department takes pride in its daily commitment to collaboration and to the kind of rigorously critical, team-based projects the department develops with its students, staff, and faculty both in the classroom and in its production season.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>By the end of their time in D&amp;PS, beyond TDPS goals, students should possess the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal, written form.</li>

	<li>Collaborative skills.</li>
	<li>Foundational stagecraft and production skills and knowledge (e.g., design, craft and technology, stage management, and new media).</li>
	<li>Literacy in foundational dramatic texts and fundamental concepts of performance theory.</li>
	<li>Basic history of Euro-American dance practice, including issues of race, ethnicity, and multiculturalism in the performing arts.</li>
	<li>Basic modern/contemporary dance technique in the Western concert dance tradition.</li>
	<li>Understanding of the choreographic process and the tools necessary for this process.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Through upper division course work, electives, and capstone experiences students should also possess advanced training in at least one of the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Choreography.</li>
	<li>Advanced Dance Technique.</li>
	<li>History &amp; Theory of Dance.</li>
</ol>

This is a project-based class in collaborative innovation where students experience group creativity and team-based design by using techniques from across the disciplines of business, theatre, design, and art practice. They will leverage problem framing and solving techniques derived from critical thinking, systems thinking, and creative problem solving (popularly known today as design thinking). The course is grounded in a brief weekly lecture</span><span class="deschide"> that sets out the theoretical, historical, and cultural contexts for particular innovation practices, but the majority of the class involves hands-on studio-based learning guided by an interdisciplinary team of teachers leading small group collaborative projects.<br/></span><br/>

How might we characterize California? Who lives here &amp; what are the stories we tell about them? This course takes California as the site through which to explore how cultural systems of performance help shape social systems of race, considering the role performance forms–theater, film, tourism, pageants, political protests–have played in shaping California’s unique cultural and racial topography. From the theatricalization</span><span class="deschide"> of Chinatown in Rodgers’ and Hammerstein’s Flower Drum Song to that of urban riots in Twilight, from the staging of Latinx farmworker’s rights to those of post-war African American workers of the Great Migration, performance strategies have been used by a variety of agents towards a range of social &amp; political goals.</span><br/>
