				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The undergraduate major at Berkeley provides a systematic and thorough grounding in applied and theoretical statistics as well as probability. The quality and dedication of the teaching staff and faculty are extremely high. A major in Statistics from Berkeley is an excellent preparation for a career in science or industry, or for further <span class="il">academic</span> study in a wide variety of fields. The department has particular strength in Machine Learning, a key ingredient of the emerging field of Data Science. It is also very useful to combine studies of statistics and probability with other subjects. Our department excels at interdisciplinary science, and more than half of the department's undergraduate students are double or triple majors.</p>
<p>Students interested in teaching statistics and mathematics in middle or high school should pursue the teaching option within the major. Students interested in teaching should also consider the <a href="http://calteach.berkeley.edu/">Cal Teach Program</a>.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students should apply in the semester they will complete their prerequisites. For applicants with prerequisites in progress, applications will be reviewed after the grades for all prerequisites are available, 2-3 weeks after finals. For applicants who have completed all prerequisites in a previous term, applications will be reviewed and processed within a week.</p>
<p>For detailed information regarding the process of declaring the major, please see the <a href="http://statistics.berkeley.edu/programs/undergrad/major#HowtoDeclare">Statistics Department website.</a></p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The minor is for students who want to study a significant amount of statistics and probability at the upper division level. For information regarding the requirements, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>For detailed information regarding the process of declaring the minor, please see the <a href="http://statistics.berkeley.edu/programs/undergrad/minor">Statistics Department website.</a></p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://statistics.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

<h3>Cluster Course Information</h3>
<p class="p1">The applied cluster is a chance to learn about areas in which statistics can be applied and to learn specialized techniques not taught in the Statistics Department. Students need to design their own applied cluster. The courses should have a unifying theme. Picking their own applied cluster is a valuable exercise that gives students a chance to explore and refine their interests and to develop a coherent course of study. A preapproved list has been provided below. However, it is not exhaustive. Clusters may consist of courses from more than one department, but at least two must be approved courses from the same department. If students would like to use a course that is not on the list or select three courses from three different departments, the Head Undergraduate Major Faculty Adviser must approve the proposed cluster.

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which the student plans to graduate. Students who cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time should see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> C8R also includes quantitative reasoning concepts that aren’t covered in Data 8. These include certain topics in: principles of data visualization; simulation of random processes; and understanding numerical functions through their graphs. This will help prepare students for computational and quantitative courses other than Data 8.<br/>C8R takes advantage of the complementarity of computing and quantitative reasoning to enliven abstract ideas and build students’ confidence in their ability to solve real problems with quantitative tools. Students learn computer science concepts and immediately apply them to plot functions, visualize data, and simulate random events.<br/>
<br/>Foundations of Data Science (CS/Info/Stat C8, a.k.a. Data 8) is an increasingly popular class for entering students at Berkeley. Data 8 builds students’ computing skills in the first month of the semester, and students rely on these skills as the course progresses. For some students, particularly those with little prior exposure to computing, developing these skills benefits from further time and practice. C8R is a rapid introduction to Python programming, visualization, and data analysis, which will prepare students for success in Data 8.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will be able to perform basic computations in Python, including working with tabular data.<br/>
Students will be able to understand basic probabilistic simulations.<br/>
Students will be able to understand the syntactic structure of Python code.<br/>
Students will be able to use good practices in Python programming.<br/>
Students will be able to use visualizations to understand univariate data and to identify associations or causal relationships in bivariate data.</p></div>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The emphasis on simulation and the bootstrap in Data 8 gives students a concrete sense of randomness and sampling variability. Stat 140 will capitalize on this, abstraction and computation complementing each other throughout.<br/>
<br/>The syllabus has been designed to maintain a mathematical level at least equal to that in Stat 134. So Stat 140 will start faster than Stat 134 (due to the Data 8 prerequisite), avoid approximations that are unnecessary when SciPy is at hand, and replace some of the routine calculus by symbolic math done in SymPy. This will create time for a unit on the convergence and reversibility of Markov Chains as well as added focus on conditioning and Bayes methods.<br/>With about a thousand students a year taking Foundations of Data Science (Stat/CS/Info C8, a.k.a. Data 8), there is considerable demand for follow-on courses that build on the skills acquired in that class. Stat 140 is a probability course for Data 8 graduates who have also had a year of calculus and wish to go deeper into data science.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Understand the difference between math and simulation, and appreciate the power of both<br/>
Use a variety of approaches to problem solving<br/>
