				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p><span>The Conservation and Resource Studies (CRS) major is a self-designed interdisciplinary program for students interested in environmental issues and areas of interaction among natural resources, population, energy, technology, societal institutions, and cultural values. Students draw on the course offerings of the entire campus and appropriate community resources in the development of individual programs of study.</span></p>
<p><span>The major’s orientation is toward flexibility and an individualized educational approach to understanding the structure and dynamic functions of complex environmental systems within our society and biosphere. It encourages interaction among students, faculty, and community. The major’s offerings are designed to help each student formulate an area of interest, but are not in any way meant to limit the range of options available. Sample topics include environmental justice and education, sustainable development of world populations, energy and environmental policy, conservation and culture, global environmental politics, and ecological restoration and policy.</span></p>
<p>Graduates are well-prepared for careers in fields such as environmental consulting, education, health, law, community, urban or regional planning, and other related areas of environmentalism in public agencies, nonprofit conservation organizations, and private companies. Graduates are well qualified for a variety of graduate programs, including law school.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Advice on admission for freshmen and transfer students can be found on the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/#admissionstext" target="_blank">CNR Admissions Guide</a> page or the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/prospective-students" target="_blank">CNR Prospective Student website</a>. Freshman students may apply directly to the major, or they may select the College of Natural Resource's undeclared option and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. Transfer students may apply directly to the major through the UC application.</p>
<p>Information for current Berkeley students who would like to declare the major after admission, including information on a change of major or change of college, please see chapter 6 of the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">College of Natural Resources Undergraduate Student Handbook</a><a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook">.</a></p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with a GPA of 3.6 or higher may enroll in the College of Natural Resources honors program (H196) once they have reached upper division standing. To fulfill the program requirements, students design, conduct, and report on an individual research project working with a faculty sponsor. For further information on registering for the honors symposium and on honors requirements, please see the <a href="http://nature.berkeley.edu/site/honors_program.php">College of Natural Resources website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor in Conservation and Resource Studies. For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the department.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two options for completing the CRS minor: Option 1, which requires students to follow a predetermined curriculum; or Option 2, which allows students to design their own minor around a topic of interest.</p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Conservation and Resource Studies (CRS) is an interdisciplinary major designed for students interested in environmental issues and interactions among disciplines related to natural resources, population, energy, technology, societal in situations, and cultural values. Because CRS students draw on the course offerings of the entire campus, they have the flexibility to incorporate any combination of courses in the social sciences, biological sciences, physical sciences, or humanities to address complex environmental problems. Students may also draw upon appropriate community resources in the development of individual programs of study. Despite the flexibility and breadth, all CRS curricula share a demonstrable commitment to gaining a truly interdisciplinary education.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Understand environmental issues and interactions among disciplines related to natural resources, population, energy, technology, societal institutions, and cultural values:
	<ul>
		<li>Understand the ways in which natural resources are central to the continued welfare of human society and the non-human world.</li>
		<li>Critically analyze the ways in which human population growth affects natural resources and human well-being and survival.</li>
		<li>Recognize the ways in which energy growth and energy systems affect the long-term welfare of both the earth and its human inhabitants.</li>
		<li>Evaluate the ways in which industrial, biological, and appropriate technologies and technological scales impact human society and life on Earth.</li>
		<li>Understand the interactions among social, political, and cultural institutions and values and how they affect the conservation of natural resources.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Comprehend the different ways in which the social sciences, biological sciences, physical sciences, and humanities address complex environmental problems:
	<ul>
		<li>Recognize the frameworks and methods used by the social sciences in approaching and resolving environmental problems.</li>
		<li>Grasp the methods and analytical concepts used in the biological and physical sciences in solving environmental problems.</li>
		<li>Be able to explain the role and importance of the humanities in resolving environmental problems.</li>
		<li>Identify the aim of one’s own education as truly interdisciplinary and select the courses that will allow its achievement.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Have the ability to draw upon appropriate community resources in the development of approaches to environmental problem-solving:
	<ul>

		<li>Develop the skills that will assess the value of community efforts and methods regarding conservation and environmental issues.</li>
		<li>Use access to community groups to introduce ideas that may be applicable to the particular problems with which they are engaged.</li>
		<li>Advance an argument for a policy or regulatory action on any issue in the environmental field with a technical or scientific component.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Be able to address diversity in both human society and the environment:
	<ul>
		<li>Explain the historical and cultural origins of diversity within human societies.</li>
		<li>Understand how power, prejudice, and poverty can create disparities within society and how these disparities might be overcome.</li>
		<li>Assess the importance of biotic diversity for conservation and human welfare.</li>
		<li>Understand how biological diversity and cultural diversity can interact in ways that can conserve life on the planet.</li>
		<li>Learn to live with biodiversity and cultural diversity in all aspects of life.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
