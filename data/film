				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Berkeley offers an interdisciplinary undergraduate program leading to a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in film. The program offers rigorous engagement with the entire culture of moving-images, teaching students to think historically, theoretically, and analytically about a wide range of cinematic forms. At the same time, it encourages students to look at moving images from the vantage point of other disciplines. To this end, the Department of Film and Media cooperates with a number of other departments and programs on campus. Students earning their BA in Film may also choose to complement their study of the history and theory of moving images with the hands-on experience provided by production classes.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>To declare a major in film, students must have completed a minimum of 30 units, and have satisfactorily completed <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=FILM%2025A" title="FILM 25A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'FILM 25A');">FILM 25A</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=FILM%2025B" title="FILM 25B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'FILM 25B');">FILM 25B</a></span>. For further information regarding prerequisites, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>

<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To be eligible for admission to the honors program in film, a student must have attained senior standing with a grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 or higher on all University work and a 3.5 GPA or higher in courses in the major. The levels of honors are as follows: honors, high honors, and highest honors. Students in the honors program are to take <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=FILM%20H195" title="FILM H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'FILM H195');">FILM H195</a></span> for a letter grade to complete a senior honors thesis. Although the production of a film may be part of the preparation of the thesis — and the film may be submitted as a documentation, or example — it is expected that the thesis will be a substantial piece of writing on film criticism or film history.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in film.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://fm.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>
			</div>
			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit. There are a few exceptions (See Major Advisor for details).</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs, with the exception of minors offered outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements. In addition, all upper- and lower-division courses used to fulfill major requirements need to be passed with a C- or better.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding residence requirements and unit requirements, please see the College Requirements tab.</p>
<h3>Language Requirement</h3>
<p><strong>Film majors have three options for completing their language requirement ( this will only apply to students admitted before Fall 2017 ):</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Students may complete the third semester of a college-level language course in a single language.</li>
	<li>Students may choose to complete the second semester of a college-level language course in two different languages. If a student has taken three or more years of a language in high school, that language can count as one of the two languages. In this case, students are required to only complete the second semester of one additional language.</li>
	<li>Native/Heritage Speakers of a language major may receive a waiver for the foreign language requirement by taking a proficiency test in the sponsoring department. International students will be required to provide a copy of a high-school transcript from home to verify coursework in native language at the high-school level.</li>
</ol>
<p>Language courses which are strictly conversational are not acceptable. Students may enroll in the courses being used to satisfy the film language requirement on a <em>Pass/No Pass</em> basis. Students should be aware that if they are also using the course to satisfy the foreign language requirement, it must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Any natural language is acceptable. Students who are native speakers of a language other than English may demonstrate their language competency by satisfactorily passing a language proficiency exam administered by a language department at UC Berkeley or by taking an advanced course in the language (such as an upper division course which is taught in the language). Students are expected to demonstrate both verbal and written proficiency.</p>
<p><strong>New Requirements beginning Fall 2017 ( All incoming freshman and newly admitted transfers will be held to the new language policy ):</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Students may complete the second semester or higher of a college-level language course in one language, which has to be taken at UC Berkeley (this means French 2, German 2, etc. or higher: French 102 or another upper division course taught in the target language). Students should take a course at the appropriate level. Student with no language background should take the first and second semester sequence in one language. </li>
	<li>The class must be taken for a letter grade and with minimum of a C- grade or better.  </li>
	<li>There will be no waivers or credit given for courses completed in high school or at community college. Film majors have to take at least one language course at UC Berkeley, second-semester level or higher as appropriate to their background, in order to pass the requirement. The requirement cannot be completed at an outside institution (with the exception of UC-approved study abroad programs). This rule also applies for transfer students who took a four-semester sequence at community college, students must enroll in one further language course at Berkeley, preferably an upper division language. course. </li>
	<li>Native/Heritage speakers are no longer exempt from the requirement to take a UC course, but they can take the heritage-speaker version of their native language or another language. International students will be required to provide a copy of a high-school transcript from home to verify coursework in native language at the high-school level.</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>After completing the film major, a student will have a working knowledge of the film-making process from concept to exhibition and will be able to interpret films through a variety of aesthetic, cultural, historical, and theoretical frameworks. The critical thinking skills promoted in the film major involve seeing beyond one’s immediate reactions to a film by developing a repertoire of productive interpretive questions and approaches that lead to more complex understanding and appreciation of the filmic experience. Analytic reasoning is encouraged in both oral and written assignments that require students to perform systematic analysis of film sequences, to construct careful, step-by-step arguments in larger research projects, or to create a coherently constructed film or script. Communication skills are developed through participation in classroom discussions, in the effective writing of critical essays and research papers, and in the articulation of creative ideas through film-making and scriptwriting.</p>
<p>More specifically, the successful graduate from the film major must be able to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Do a shot-and-sequence analysis both orally in class and in a written form.</li>
	<li>Creatively re-edit a sequence from a silent film.</li>
	<li>Think beyond the surface impressions of popular films by developing a repertoire of critical questions and approaches that facilitate deeper understanding.</li>
	<li>Analyze and write about alternative kinds of moving images (silent, avant-garde, documentary, foreign-language, art films).</li>
	<li>Identify the major movements in film history.</li>
	<li>Talk and write about how an individual film fits within this history and the mode of production from which it emerges.</li>
	<li>Situate the major movements of cinema within a broader socio-historical context.</li>
	<li>Describe the major cinematic genres and analyze an individual film as an example of one or more of these genres.</li>
	<li>Summarize the arguments for and against the notion of film authorship, and talk knowledgeably about the work of at least one director.</li>
	<li>Describe a number of different theoretical approaches to film.</li>
	<li>Utilize this theoretical knowledge when analyzing a film, making a film, and writing a screenplay.</li>
	<li>Write essays and papers that are clear, well-researched and organized, and that mount an original argument.</li>
	<li>Organize ideas in oral presentations and general classroom discussions.</li>

This course considers how the American detective is represented in fiction, fil, and popular culture. We will examine how representations of the American detective are affected by diverse historican and socio-cultural factors, including the ideology of American individualism, paradigms of investigation and ordered knowledge, and competing discourses of race, class, gender, and sexual orientation. After a brief consideration of early American detectives and detectives</span><span class="deschide"> in the classic American hardboiled tradition, we will focus on many detectives from traditionally understudied groups, including female detectives, African American detectives, Chicana detectives, Asian American detectives, Native American detectives, and gay and lesbian detectives.

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course explores the international development of artist made, experimental and avant-garde film, electronic or new media practices. It looks at the ways artists have invented new formal languages in order to express their unique ideas and vision, and also how they have created alternative modes of production, distribution, and exhibition for their work. The course examines major movements in experimental and alternative media that exist outside of the constraints of industrial and mass media forms, as it at once critiques and expands dominant forms of media.<br/>To broaden student awareness &amp; understanding of the history of experimental &amp; alternative film &amp; media practices that exist outside of the dominant film industry, including fine art practices that have emerged from the visual &amp; sonic arts rather than the dominant literary &amp; dramatic forms. To study underground &amp; marginal communities that have been under or unrepresented by the dominant film &amp; media industries. The course will also look beyond the artwork itself to explore the kinds of creative sub-cultures communities that this approach to art making has produced.<br/>
While emphasis on medium and technology may vary from year to year, depending on the instructor, conceptually, the course will always focus on film and media art as a form of personal and creative expression with a philosophical position that emphasizes process and invention over product and professional mastery.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Acquire a conceptual and aesthetic vocabulary necessary for the recognition and interpretation of experimental and alternative media practices in different media forms and technologies and to understand why experimental approaches to media practices have influenced, the dominant film and media world, the art world and academic film and media studies.<br/>
Acquire new informational content about the national/regional/global media landscape in question; with an emphasis on the role experimental film and media products play in the evolution of film and media language and form.<br/>
Develop the analytic skills necessary to interpret in a socio-historical and aesthetic context the art and media objects belonging to that area and learn about the cultural contexts in which those media practices are located.<br/>
