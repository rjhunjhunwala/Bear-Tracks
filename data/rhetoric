				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Rhetoric majors are trained in the history of rhetorical theory and practice, grounded in argumentation and in the analysis of the symbolic and institutional dimensions of discourse. The department offers both a pragmatic understanding of the elements of rhetorical analysis, with special attention to logic, style, tropes, figures, and images, and a thorough grounding in the historical development of these elements in rhetorical theory. The combination allows students to make a disciplined grasp of the contemporary character of rhetoric and language. Through its emphasis on the history and theory of rhetoric, the department provides an understanding of the format of contemporary theories of interpretation as well as an opportunity, within this framework, to explore the role of persuasion in pragmatic and aesthetic contexts.</p>
<p><span>The major is not intended to provide skills-based training in oral argument or communication.</span></p>
<h3>Major Concentrations</h3>
<p>Students in the Rhetoric major choose one area of concentration: history and theory of rhetoric, public discourse, or narrative and image.</p>
<h5><strong>History and Theory of Rhetoric</strong></h5>
<p>This area of concentration focuses on understanding the development of rhetorical theory and practice from its genesis in the classical period to its situation in the present. Students will consider how the discipline of rhetoric has both shaped and itself been shaped by social, political, technological, and intellectual developments over the course of two millennia. Individual courses will enable close study of the process of rhetoric's influence and adaptation, both in theory and in practice, in specific contexts throughout its history.</p>
<h5><strong>Public Discourse</strong></h5>
<p>This area of concentration focuses on understanding rhetoric in its symbolic and institutional dimensions, with special emphasis on legal and political forums. Students consider the discourse of law, politics, and society both in theory and in practice, in an attempt to understand the rhetorical nature of political judgment, action, justice, and legitimacy. Individual courses will enable close study of specific problems, concerns, vocabularies, modes of interpretation, and strategies of argumentation arising in public forums of the past and present.</p>
<h5>Narrative and Image</h5>
<p>This area of concentration focuses on understanding the function of rhetoric in literary, cinematic, and visual texts, with emphasis on the role of figure and image in the representation of reality. Students consider the production and reception of narrative literature—oral, epic, folktale, lyric poem, novel, and film—in an attempt to understand the boundaries of the aesthetic text as a rhetorical analysis of particular literary and visual genres arising in a variety of cultures and historical epochs. </p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>The major may be declared after completion of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%2010" title="RHETOR 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR 10');">RHETOR 10</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%2020" title="RHETOR 20" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR 20');">RHETOR 20</a></span> with a letter grade of C or better. Obtain a Petition to Declare the Major and the Rhetoric Major Application from the undergraduate assistant in 7406 Dwinelle Hall. The petition is also available from the College of Letters &amp; Science in 206 Evans Hall. Students must present a copy of their transcript along with their petition and application to the undergraduate assistant for approval signature and a brief orientation.</p>

<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Seniors must complete <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%2010" title="RHETOR 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR 10');">RHETOR 10</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%2020" title="RHETOR 20" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR 20');">RHETOR 20</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%20103A" title="RHETOR 103A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR 103A');">RHETOR 103A</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%20103B" title="RHETOR 103B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR 103B');">RHETOR 103B</a></span> and maintain a minimum 3.7 grade-point average (GPA) in rhetoric and a 3.5 overall Berkeley GPA to undertake the two-semester honors thesis series, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%20H190A" title="RHETOR H190A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR H190A');">RHETOR H190A</a></span>-<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%20H190B" title="RHETOR H190B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR H190B');">RHETOR H190B</a></span>.

Four units of credit (2 units each semester) for the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%20H190A" title="RHETOR H190A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR H190A');">RHETOR H190A</a></span> to <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%20H190B" title="RHETOR H190B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR H190B');">RHETOR H190B</a></span> sequence may be applied toward graduation as upper division units and fulfillment of one major upper division course. Honors candidates who complete the 4-unit course with a letter grade of A- or better and maintain the required GPAs will receive a BA with honors in the major.</p>

<p>Seniors eligible to enroll in the honors program must begin arrangements with the faculty member who is willing to direct their honors thesis in the semester before they enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%20H190A" title="RHETOR H190A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR H190A');">RHETOR H190A</a></span>.

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The goal of the minor program in rhetoric is to introduce students to the methodological procedures and interdisciplinary approach of a field that examines all disciplines from the outside and poses questions such as the following: how is philosophy (or law, politics, etc.) constituted as a field? What kinds of discourses are considered legitimate within this field? And what kinds of knowledge are produced and institutionalized as a result?</p>
<p>Students should declare at least one semester prior to graduation. For details on how to declare, please contact our department directly.&quot; <span>The </span><a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/fp/fp.html">Minor Completion</a><span> petition should be presented to the undergraduate adviser with a recent </span>Bear Facts (available through summer 2016) or <a href="https://calcentral.berkeley.edu/">CalCentral</a> (starting fall 2016)<span> printout of the student's grades (unofficial transcript).</span></p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://rhetoric.berkeley.edu/index.php" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Students should declare at least one semester prior to graduation. For details on how to declare, please contact our department directly.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Students learn about different kinds of representation (and critiques thereof), how different genres shape and offer material for interpretation, and how different media forms produce a sense of reality. They learn to reflect on how various modes of presentation work (film, literary and philosophical texts, legal cases, political tracts, performances, archival materials), what kinds of meanings they have, and what kinds of effects they produce. They consider works of both high and low culture and bring various kinds of approaches to both. As they advance, students compare and bring genres together for analysis, working for instance with legal trials in film, philosophical uses of literary works, oral interpretation of texts, the textual and archival basis for the transition from orality to literacy, the political presuppositions of law, the aesthetic dimensions of political theory, and the influence of law on non-legal rhetorical practice.</p>

		<li>Recognize what is common and what is different in the self-conception of various discourses (e.g., literature, philosophy, law, and history).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Integrate the reading, writing, analytical, and critical skills and knowledges above

This class examines the way in which a distinctively rhetorical concern with persuasion, tropes, topicality, and modes of appeal can be engaged in readings of Shakespearean texts. Using written documents from the period along with contemporary rhetorical criticism and theory, the class analyzes the importance of rhetoric in the production and performance of Shakespeare's plays, in their particular rendering of verbal conflict and the scene of persuasion</span><span class="deschide">, and in the analysis of their participation in larger cultural contests over the legitimacy of the prevailing political, legal, moral, or natural order.</span><br/>

Participants in this course can expect to accomplish two goals: they will become familiar with a fair amount of the two epics attributed to Homer; and they will learn how classical texts are received by later generations, with Homer as the centerpiece example. That is, we will look at the way in which classical texts are transmitted from the past and how they have survived (or have failed to survive) from antiquity into the present; how readers have sought to make</span><span class="deschide"> sense of them and to locate them in reality; and how Homer’s originally sung texts were changed while still remaining identifiably “Homeric,” and in this way came to constitute a Homeric tradition that continues to flourish today.</span><br/>

Can you live ethically without following moral norms, that is, norms as these are given institutionally and reinforced by culture and/or convention? The question, which is at least as old as the Cynics, gathered steam again in the nineteenth century starting with Nietzsche, and it remains a vital problem today. Paradoxical though it may seem, some of the staunchest critics of moral systems and moral norms are at the same time powerful advocates of non-normative</span><span class="deschide"> ethical reflection and action.

How does one become more aware of oneself as mover, doer, learner, knower? How does one learn? Does one learn to do things with language - to read, to write, even to think - in the same ways as one learns to move? In this class, we will consider these sorts of questions through experiences with and responses to very basic movement lessons and to academic readings, as well as through writing and discussion. The primary aim is for you to become more aware</span><span class="deschide"> of the way you move and the way you use language and, through this awareness, to become more skilled at what you want to say and do.<br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Rhetoric majors are trained in the history of rhetorical theory and practice, grounded in argumentation and in the analysis of the symbolic and institutional dimensions of discourse. The department offers both a pragmatic understanding of the elements of rhetorical analysis, with special attention to logic, style, tropes, figures, and images, and a thorough grounding in the historical development of these elements in rhetorical theory. The combination allows students to make a disciplined grasp of the contemporary character of rhetoric and language. Through its emphasis on the history and theory of rhetoric, the department provides an understanding of the format of contemporary theories of interpretation as well as an opportunity, within this framework, to explore the role of persuasion in pragmatic and aesthetic contexts.</p>
<p><span>The major is not intended to provide skills-based training in oral argument or communication.</span></p>
<h3>Major Concentrations</h3>
<p>Students in the Rhetoric major choose one area of concentration: history and theory of rhetoric, public discourse, or narrative and image.</p>
<h5><strong>History and Theory of Rhetoric</strong></h5>
<p>This area of concentration focuses on understanding the development of rhetorical theory and practice from its genesis in the classical period to its situation in the present. Students will consider how the discipline of rhetoric has both shaped and itself been shaped by social, political, technological, and intellectual developments over the course of two millennia. Individual courses will enable close study of the process of rhetoric's influence and adaptation, both in theory and in practice, in specific contexts throughout its history.</p>
<h5><strong>Public Discourse</strong></h5>
<p>This area of concentration focuses on understanding rhetoric in its symbolic and institutional dimensions, with special emphasis on legal and political forums. Students consider the discourse of law, politics, and society both in theory and in practice, in an attempt to understand the rhetorical nature of political judgment, action, justice, and legitimacy. Individual courses will enable close study of specific problems, concerns, vocabularies, modes of interpretation, and strategies of argumentation arising in public forums of the past and present.</p>
<h5>Narrative and Image</h5>
<p>This area of concentration focuses on understanding the function of rhetoric in literary, cinematic, and visual texts, with emphasis on the role of figure and image in the representation of reality. Students consider the production and reception of narrative literature—oral, epic, folktale, lyric poem, novel, and film—in an attempt to understand the boundaries of the aesthetic text as a rhetorical analysis of particular literary and visual genres arising in a variety of cultures and historical epochs. </p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>The major may be declared after completion of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%2010" title="RHETOR 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR 10');">RHETOR 10</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%2020" title="RHETOR 20" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR 20');">RHETOR 20</a></span> with a letter grade of C or better. Obtain a Petition to Declare the Major and the Rhetoric Major Application from the undergraduate assistant in 7406 Dwinelle Hall. The petition is also available from the College of Letters &amp; Science in 206 Evans Hall. Students must present a copy of their transcript along with their petition and application to the undergraduate assistant for approval signature and a brief orientation.</p>

<p>Seniors must complete <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%2010" title="RHETOR 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR 10');">RHETOR 10</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%2020" title="RHETOR 20" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR 20');">RHETOR 20</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%20103A" title="RHETOR 103A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR 103A');">RHETOR 103A</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%20103B" title="RHETOR 103B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR 103B');">RHETOR 103B</a></span> and maintain a minimum 3.7 grade-point average (GPA) in rhetoric and a 3.5 overall Berkeley GPA to undertake the two-semester honors thesis series, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%20H190A" title="RHETOR H190A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR H190A');">RHETOR H190A</a></span>-<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%20H190B" title="RHETOR H190B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR H190B');">RHETOR H190B</a></span>. Students work under the supervision of a selected rhetoric faculty member. Four units of credit (2 units each semester) for the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%20H190A" title="RHETOR H190A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR H190A');">RHETOR H190A</a></span> to <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%20H190B" title="RHETOR H190B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR H190B');">RHETOR H190B</a></span> sequence may be applied toward graduation as upper division units and fulfillment of one major upper division course. Honors candidates who complete the 4-unit course with a letter grade of A- or better and maintain the required GPAs will receive a BA with honors in the major.</p>

<p>Seniors eligible to enroll in the honors program must begin arrangements with the faculty member who is willing to direct their honors thesis in the semester before they enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%20H190A" title="RHETOR H190A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR H190A');">RHETOR H190A</a></span>.

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The goal of the minor program in rhetoric is to introduce students to the methodological procedures and interdisciplinary approach of a field that examines all disciplines from the outside and poses questions such as the following: how is philosophy (or law, politics, etc.) constituted as a field? What kinds of discourses are considered legitimate within this field? And what kinds of knowledge are produced and institutionalized as a result?</p>
<p>Students should declare at least one semester prior to graduation. For details on how to declare, please contact our department directly.&quot; <span>The </span><a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/fp/fp.html">Minor Completion</a><span> petition should be presented to the undergraduate adviser with a recent </span>Bear Facts (available through summer 2016) or <a href="https://calcentral.berkeley.edu/">CalCentral</a> (starting fall 2016)<span> printout of the student's grades (unofficial transcript).</span></p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://rhetoric.berkeley.edu/index.php" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Students learn about different kinds of representation (and critiques thereof), how different genres shape and offer material for interpretation, and how different media forms produce a sense of reality. They learn to reflect on how various modes of presentation work (film, literary and philosophical texts, legal cases, political tracts, performances, archival materials), what kinds of meanings they have, and what kinds of effects they produce. They consider works of both high and low culture and bring various kinds of approaches to both. As they advance, students compare and bring genres together for analysis, working for instance with legal trials in film, philosophical uses of literary works, oral interpretation of texts, the textual and archival basis for the transition from orality to literacy, the political presuppositions of law, the aesthetic dimensions of political theory, and the influence of law on non-legal rhetorical practice.</p>

		<li>Recognize what is common and what is different in the self-conception of various discourses (e.g., literature, philosophy, law, and history).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Integrate the reading, writing, analytical, and critical skills and knowledges above

Participants in this course can expect to accomplish two goals: they will become familiar with a fair amount of the two epics attributed to Homer; and they will learn how classical texts are received by later generations, with Homer as the centerpiece example. That is, we will look at the way in which classical texts are transmitted from the past and how they have survived (or have failed to survive) from antiquity into the present; how readers have sought to make</span><span class="deschide"> sense of them and to locate them in reality; and how Homer’s originally sung texts were changed while still remaining identifiably “Homeric,” and in this way came to constitute a Homeric tradition that continues to flourish today.</span><br/>

Can you live ethically without following moral norms, that is, norms as these are given institutionally and reinforced by culture and/or convention? The question, which is at least as old as the Cynics, gathered steam again in the nineteenth century starting with Nietzsche, and it remains a vital problem today. Paradoxical though it may seem, some of the staunchest critics of moral systems and moral norms are at the same time powerful advocates of non-normative</span><span class="deschide"> ethical reflection and action.

How does one become more aware of oneself as mover, doer, learner, knower? How does one learn? Does one learn to do things with language - to read, to write, even to think - in the same ways as one learns to move? In this class, we will consider these sorts of questions through experiences with and responses to very basic movement lessons and to academic readings, as well as through writing and discussion. The primary aim is for you to become more aware</span><span class="deschide"> of the way you move and the way you use language and, through this awareness, to become more skilled at what you want to say and do.<br/>

<p>Rhetoric majors are trained in the history of rhetorical theory and practice, grounded in argumentation and in the analysis of the symbolic and institutional dimensions of discourse. The department offers both a pragmatic understanding of the elements of rhetorical analysis, with special attention to logic, style, tropes, figures, and images, and a thorough grounding in the historical development of these elements in rhetorical theory. The combination allows students to make a disciplined grasp of the contemporary character of rhetoric and language. Through its emphasis on the history and theory of rhetoric, the department provides an understanding of the format of contemporary theories of interpretation as well as an opportunity, within this framework, to explore the role of persuasion in pragmatic and aesthetic contexts.</p>
<p><span>The major is not intended to provide skills-based training in oral argument or communication.</span></p>
<h3>Major Concentrations</h3>
<p>Students in the Rhetoric major choose one area of concentration: history and theory of rhetoric, public discourse, or narrative and image.</p>
<h5><strong>History and Theory of Rhetoric</strong></h5>
<p>This area of concentration focuses on understanding the development of rhetorical theory and practice from its genesis in the classical period to its situation in the present. Students will consider how the discipline of rhetoric has both shaped and itself been shaped by social, political, technological, and intellectual developments over the course of two millennia. Individual courses will enable close study of the process of rhetoric's influence and adaptation, both in theory and in practice, in specific contexts throughout its history.</p>
<h5><strong>Public Discourse</strong></h5>
<p>This area of concentration focuses on understanding rhetoric in its symbolic and institutional dimensions, with special emphasis on legal and political forums. Students consider the discourse of law, politics, and society both in theory and in practice, in an attempt to understand the rhetorical nature of political judgment, action, justice, and legitimacy. Individual courses will enable close study of specific problems, concerns, vocabularies, modes of interpretation, and strategies of argumentation arising in public forums of the past and present.</p>
<h5>Narrative and Image</h5>
<p>This area of concentration focuses on understanding the function of rhetoric in literary, cinematic, and visual texts, with emphasis on the role of figure and image in the representation of reality. Students consider the production and reception of narrative literature—oral, epic, folktale, lyric poem, novel, and film—in an attempt to understand the boundaries of the aesthetic text as a rhetorical analysis of particular literary and visual genres arising in a variety of cultures and historical epochs. </p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>The major may be declared after completion of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%2010" title="RHETOR 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR 10');">RHETOR 10</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%2020" title="RHETOR 20" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR 20');">RHETOR 20</a></span> with a letter grade of C or better.

Honors candidates who complete the 4-unit course with a letter grade of A- or better and maintain the required GPAs will receive a BA with honors in the major.</p>

<p>Seniors eligible to enroll in the honors program must begin arrangements with the faculty member who is willing to direct their honors thesis in the semester before they enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%20H190A" title="RHETOR H190A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR H190A');">RHETOR H190A</a></span>.

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The goal of the minor program in rhetoric is to introduce students to the methodological procedures and interdisciplinary approach of a field that examines all disciplines from the outside and poses questions such as the following: how is philosophy (or law, politics, etc.) constituted as a field? What kinds of discourses are considered legitimate within this field? And what kinds of knowledge are produced and institutionalized as a result?</p>
<p>Students should declare at least one semester prior to graduation. For details on how to declare, please contact our department directly.&quot; <span>The </span><a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/fp/fp.html">Minor Completion</a><span> petition should be presented to the undergraduate adviser with a recent </span>Bear Facts (available through summer 2016) or <a href="https://calcentral.berkeley.edu/">CalCentral</a> (starting fall 2016)<span> printout of the student's grades (unofficial transcript).</span></p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://rhetoric.berkeley.edu/index.php" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Students learn about different kinds of representation (and critiques thereof), how different genres shape and offer material for interpretation, and how different media forms produce a sense of reality. They learn to reflect on how various modes of presentation work (film, literary and philosophical texts, legal cases, political tracts, performances, archival materials), what kinds of meanings they have, and what kinds of effects they produce. They consider works of both high and low culture and bring various kinds of approaches to both. As they advance, students compare and bring genres together for analysis, working for instance with legal trials in film, philosophical uses of literary works, oral interpretation of texts, the textual and archival basis for the transition from orality to literacy, the political presuppositions of law, the aesthetic dimensions of political theory, and the influence of law on non-legal rhetorical practice.</p>

		<li>Recognize what is common and what is different in the self-conception of various discourses (e.g., literature, philosophy, law, and history).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

Participants in this course can expect to accomplish two goals: they will become familiar with a fair amount of the two epics attributed to Homer; and they will learn how classical texts are received by later generations, with Homer as the centerpiece example. That is, we will look at the way in which classical texts are transmitted from the past and how they have survived (or have failed to survive) from antiquity into the present; how readers have sought to make</span><span class="deschide"> sense of them and to locate them in reality; and how Homer’s originally sung texts were changed while still remaining identifiably “Homeric,” and in this way came to constitute a Homeric tradition that continues to flourish today.</span><br/>

Can you live ethically without following moral norms, that is, norms as these are given institutionally and reinforced by culture and/or convention? The question, which is at least as old as the Cynics, gathered steam again in the nineteenth century starting with Nietzsche, and it remains a vital problem today. Paradoxical though it may seem, some of the staunchest critics of moral systems and moral norms are at the same time powerful advocates of non-normative</span><span class="deschide"> ethical reflection and action.

How does one become more aware of oneself as mover, doer, learner, knower? How does one learn? Does one learn to do things with language - to read, to write, even to think - in the same ways as one learns to move? In this class, we will consider these sorts of questions through experiences with and responses to very basic movement lessons and to academic readings, as well as through writing and discussion. The primary aim is for you to become more aware</span><span class="deschide"> of the way you move and the way you use language and, through this awareness, to become more skilled at what you want to say and do.<br/>

<p>Rhetoric majors are trained in the history of rhetorical theory and practice, grounded in argumentation and in the analysis of the symbolic and institutional dimensions of discourse. The department offers both a pragmatic understanding of the elements of rhetorical analysis, with special attention to logic, style, tropes, figures, and images, and a thorough grounding in the historical development of these elements in rhetorical theory. The combination allows students to make a disciplined grasp of the contemporary character of rhetoric and language. Through its emphasis on the history and theory of rhetoric, the department provides an understanding of the format of contemporary theories of interpretation as well as an opportunity, within this framework, to explore the role of persuasion in pragmatic and aesthetic contexts.</p>
<p><span>The major is not intended to provide skills-based training in oral argument or communication.</span></p>
<h3>Major Concentrations</h3>
<p>Students in the Rhetoric major choose one area of concentration: history and theory of rhetoric, public discourse, or narrative and image.</p>
<h5><strong>History and Theory of Rhetoric</strong></h5>
<p>This area of concentration focuses on understanding the development of rhetorical theory and practice from its genesis in the classical period to its situation in the present. Students will consider how the discipline of rhetoric has both shaped and itself been shaped by social, political, technological, and intellectual developments over the course of two millennia. Individual courses will enable close study of the process of rhetoric's influence and adaptation, both in theory and in practice, in specific contexts throughout its history.</p>
<h5><strong>Public Discourse</strong></h5>
<p>This area of concentration focuses on understanding rhetoric in its symbolic and institutional dimensions, with special emphasis on legal and political forums. Students consider the discourse of law, politics, and society both in theory and in practice, in an attempt to understand the rhetorical nature of political judgment, action, justice, and legitimacy. Individual courses will enable close study of specific problems, concerns, vocabularies, modes of interpretation, and strategies of argumentation arising in public forums of the past and present.</p>
<h5>Narrative and Image</h5>
<p>This area of concentration focuses on understanding the function of rhetoric in literary, cinematic, and visual texts, with emphasis on the role of figure and image in the representation of reality. Students consider the production and reception of narrative literature—oral, epic, folktale, lyric poem, novel, and film—in an attempt to understand the boundaries of the aesthetic text as a rhetorical analysis of particular literary and visual genres arising in a variety of cultures and historical epochs. </p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The goal of the minor program in rhetoric is to introduce students to the methodological procedures and interdisciplinary approach of a field that examines all disciplines from the outside and poses questions such as the following: how is philosophy (or law, politics, etc.) constituted as a field? What kinds of discourses are considered legitimate within this field? And what kinds of knowledge are produced and institutionalized as a result?</p>
<p>Students should declare at least one semester prior to graduation. For details on how to declare, please contact our department directly.&quot; <span>The </span><a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/fp/fp.html">Minor Completion</a><span> petition should be presented to the undergraduate adviser with a recent </span>Bear Facts (available through summer 2016) or <a href="https://calcentral.berkeley.edu/">CalCentral</a> (starting fall 2016)<span> printout of the student's grades (unofficial transcript).</span></p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://rhetoric.berkeley.edu/index.php" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Students learn about different kinds of representation (and critiques thereof), how different genres shape and offer material for interpretation, and how different media forms produce a sense of reality. They learn to reflect on how various modes of presentation work (film, literary and philosophical texts, legal cases, political tracts, performances, archival materials), what kinds of meanings they have, and what kinds of effects they produce. They consider works of both high and low culture and bring various kinds of approaches to both. As they advance, students compare and bring genres together for analysis, working for instance with legal trials in film, philosophical uses of literary works, oral interpretation of texts, the textual and archival basis for the transition from orality to literacy, the political presuppositions of law, the aesthetic dimensions of political theory, and the influence of law on non-legal rhetorical practice.</p>

		<li>Read visual and other productions that are beyond (or other than) the written word.</li>
		<li>Recognize what is common and what is different in the self-conception of various discourses (e.g., literature, philosophy, law, and history).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Integrate the reading, writing, analytical, and critical skills and knowledges above
	<ul>

Participants in this course can expect to accomplish two goals: they will become familiar with a fair amount of the two epics attributed to Homer; and they will learn how classical texts are received by later generations, with Homer as the centerpiece example. That is, we will look at the way in which classical texts are transmitted from the past and how they have survived (or have failed to survive) from antiquity into the present; how readers have sought to make</span><span class="deschide"> sense of them and to locate them in reality; and how Homer’s originally sung texts were changed while still remaining identifiably “Homeric,” and in this way came to constitute a Homeric tradition that continues to flourish today.</span><br/>

Can you live ethically without following moral norms, that is, norms as these are given institutionally and reinforced by culture and/or convention? The question, which is at least as old as the Cynics, gathered steam again in the nineteenth century starting with Nietzsche, and it remains a vital problem today. Paradoxical though it may seem, some of the staunchest critics of moral systems and moral norms are at the same time powerful advocates of non-normative</span><span class="deschide"> ethical reflection and action.

This course examines the centrality of sexual difference and sexual exchange to the structuring of societies, cultures, and political life. Possible topics include theories of desire and corporeality; the figure of woman as object of exchange in historical and contemporary contexts such as Sati, prostitution, surrogacy and IVF, and the global traffic in female labor; and an examination of how sexual difference functions as a blind-spot in</span><span class="deschide"> theories of culture, society, and economy.</span><br/>

How does one become more aware of oneself as mover, doer, learner, knower? How does one learn? Does one learn to do things with language - to read, to write, even to think - in the same ways as one learns to move? In this class, we will consider these sorts of questions through experiences with and responses to very basic movement lessons and to academic readings, as well as through writing and discussion. The primary aim is for you to become more aware</span><span class="deschide"> of the way you move and the way you use language and, through this awareness, to become more skilled at what you want to say and do.<br/>

<p>Rhetoric majors are trained in the history of rhetorical theory and practice, grounded in argumentation and in the analysis of the symbolic and institutional dimensions of discourse. The department offers both a pragmatic understanding of the elements of rhetorical analysis, with special attention to logic, style, tropes, figures, and images, and a thorough grounding in the historical development of these elements in rhetorical theory. The combination allows students to make a disciplined grasp of the contemporary character of rhetoric and language. Through its emphasis on the history and theory of rhetoric, the department provides an understanding of the format of contemporary theories of interpretation as well as an opportunity, within this framework, to explore the role of persuasion in pragmatic and aesthetic contexts.</p>
<p><span>The major is not intended to provide skills-based training in oral argument or communication.</span></p>
<h3>Major Concentrations</h3>
<p>Students in the Rhetoric major choose one area of concentration: history and theory of rhetoric, public discourse, or narrative and image.</p>
<h5><strong>History and Theory of Rhetoric</strong></h5>
<p>This area of concentration focuses on understanding the development of rhetorical theory and practice from its genesis in the classical period to its situation in the present. Students will consider how the discipline of rhetoric has both shaped and itself been shaped by social, political, technological, and intellectual developments over the course of two millennia. Individual courses will enable close study of the process of rhetoric's influence and adaptation, both in theory and in practice, in specific contexts throughout its history.</p>
<h5><strong>Public Discourse</strong></h5>
<p>This area of concentration focuses on understanding rhetoric in its symbolic and institutional dimensions, with special emphasis on legal and political forums. Students consider the discourse of law, politics, and society both in theory and in practice, in an attempt to understand the rhetorical nature of political judgment, action, justice, and legitimacy. Individual courses will enable close study of specific problems, concerns, vocabularies, modes of interpretation, and strategies of argumentation arising in public forums of the past and present.</p>
<h5>Narrative and Image</h5>
<p>This area of concentration focuses on understanding the function of rhetoric in literary, cinematic, and visual texts, with emphasis on the role of figure and image in the representation of reality. Students consider the production and reception of narrative literature—oral, epic, folktale, lyric poem, novel, and film—in an attempt to understand the boundaries of the aesthetic text as a rhetorical analysis of particular literary and visual genres arising in a variety of cultures and historical epochs. </p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>The major may be declared after completion of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%2010" title="RHETOR 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR 10');">RHETOR 10</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RHETOR%2020" title="RHETOR 20" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RHETOR 20');">RHETOR 20</a></span> with a letter grade of C or better. Obtain a Petition to Declare the Major and the Rhetoric Major Application from the undergraduate assistant in 7406 Dwinelle Hall. The petition is also available from the College of Letters &amp; Science in 206 Evans Hall.

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The goal of the minor program in rhetoric is to introduce students to the methodological procedures and interdisciplinary approach of a field that examines all disciplines from the outside and poses questions such as the following: how is philosophy (or law, politics, etc.) constituted as a field? What kinds of discourses are considered legitimate within this field? And what kinds of knowledge are produced and institutionalized as a result?</p>
<p>Students should declare at least one semester prior to graduation. For details on how to declare, please contact our department directly.&quot; <span>The </span><a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/fp/fp.html">Minor Completion</a><span> petition should be presented to the undergraduate adviser with a recent </span>Bear Facts (available through summer 2016) or <a href="https://calcentral.berkeley.edu/">CalCentral</a> (starting fall 2016)<span> printout of the student's grades (unofficial transcript).</span></p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://rhetoric.berkeley.edu/index.php" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Students learn about different kinds of representation (and critiques thereof), how different genres shape and offer material for interpretation, and how different media forms produce a sense of reality. They learn to reflect on how various modes of presentation work (film, literary and philosophical texts, legal cases, political tracts, performances, archival materials), what kinds of meanings they have, and what kinds of effects they produce. They consider works of both high and low culture and bring various kinds of approaches to both. As they advance, students compare and bring genres together for analysis, working for instance with legal trials in film, philosophical uses of literary works, oral interpretation of texts, the textual and archival basis for the transition from orality to literacy, the political presuppositions of law, the aesthetic dimensions of political theory, and the influence of law on non-legal rhetorical practice.</p>

Participants in this course can expect to accomplish two goals: they will become familiar with a fair amount of the two epics attributed to Homer; and they will learn how classical texts are received by later generations, with Homer as the centerpiece example. That is, we will look at the way in which classical texts are transmitted from the past and how they have survived (or have failed to survive) from antiquity into the present; how readers have sought to make</span><span class="deschide"> sense of them and to locate them in reality; and how Homer’s originally sung texts were changed while still remaining identifiably “Homeric,” and in this way came to constitute a Homeric tradition that continues to flourish today.</span><br/>

Can you live ethically without following moral norms, that is, norms as these are given institutionally and reinforced by culture and/or convention? The question, which is at least as old as the Cynics, gathered steam again in the nineteenth century starting with Nietzsche, and it remains a vital problem today. Paradoxical though it may seem, some of the staunchest critics of moral systems and moral norms are at the same time powerful advocates of non-normative</span><span class="deschide"> ethical reflection and action.
