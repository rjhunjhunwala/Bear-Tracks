				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>Materials Scientists and Engineers are involved in every aspect of technology, ranging from the design of materials appropriate for use in integrated circuits and biological applications to those materials needed for energy generation (both conventional energy sources and green sources) and for building bridges, roads, and buildings.</p>
<p>Upon graduation, students are prepared for a number of different careers paths. Many go on to graduate studies at prestigious universities. Others head directly into the workforce as engineers in Silicon Valley, the biotechnology sector, the aerospace or automotive fields, and energy-related industries.</p>
<p><span>The objectives of the undergraduate program in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) are to educate graduates who have the following skills:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>Knowledge of the fundamental science and engineering principles relevant to materials design, development and engineering application</li>
	<li>Understanding of the relationship between nano/microstructure, characterization, properties and processing and design of materials</li>
	<li>Have the experimental and computational skills for a professional career or graduate study in materials</li>
	<li>Possess a knowledge of the significance of research, the value of continued learning, and environmental/social issues surrounding materials</li>
	<li>Ability to communicate effectively, to work in teams, and to assume positions as leaders</li>
</ul>
<p>This major program leads to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the College. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there few, if any, spaces that open in the College each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Five-Year BS/MS Program</h3>
<p>The five-year combined Bachelor of Science/Master of Science program augments the existing four-year undergraduate program with a fifth year of graduate study that provides a professionally oriented component, preparing students for careers in engineering or engineering management within the business, government, and/or industrial sectors. In this program, students earn a bachelor's degree and subsequently, a Master of Science degree under Plan II (without thesis) of the Academic Senate. This five-year program emphasizes interdisciplinary study through an independent project coupled to coursework. The program is open to undergraduate materials science and engineering majors (both single or joint majors) only. For further information regarding this program, please see the <a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/undergrad/five-year">department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor in Materials Science and Engineering that is open to all students who are not majoring in MSE and who have completed the necessary prerequisites. To be eligible for the program, students are required to have a minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses. For information regarding the prerequisites, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>To apply for the minor, submit the <a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/mse-minor-petition-version-8.24.16.pdf">Petition for Admission to the Undergraduate Minor</a> to the undergraduate adviser after completion of the prerequisite courses. Upon completion of the minor requirements, submit a <a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/MSE-confirmation-of-completion-for-Minor-Version-8.24.16.pdf">Petition for Completion of the Undergraduate Minor</a> to the undergraduate adviser.</p>
<h3>Joint Majors</h3>
<p>The Department of Materials Science and Engineering also offers four joint majors, with other departments in the College of Engineering, and one joint major with a department in the College of Chemistry. For further information on these programs, please see the links below:<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>

You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework.

				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
<p>There is nothing more tangible in engineering products than the materials of which they are made, and this fact dominates the research agenda in materials science &amp; engineering around the world. At Berkeley, research programs in new materials synthesis, processing, characterization, integration, and theoretical modeling dominate the laboratory space and multiple servers dedicated to basic and applied research programs in the department, including many that are conducted at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Undergraduate students are strongly encouraged to meet with the many faculty members in the department who sponsor student research projects and learn about the many exciting options available to them. Sometimes a new student’s research experience begins by shadowing a senior graduate student to learn the ropes, but sometimes the project is fully unique, and exclusively theirs! Undergraduate students can earn units for their research efforts by enrolling in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MAT%20SCI%20199" title="MAT SCI 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MAT SCI 199');">MAT SCI 199</a></span>, which is offered on a <em>Pass/No Pass</em> basis. Another option is an honors thesis project, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MAT%20SCI%20H194" title="MAT SCI H194" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MAT SCI H194');">MAT SCI H194</a></span>, offered to qualified students as a graded course, which can therefore be counted as an upper division technical elective. There are also a number of paid research positions, especially over the summer. Students should not be shy about asking and should consider adding materials research to their undergraduate experience at Berkeley.</p>

<h3>Student Groups and Organizations</h3>
<p>The Materials Science &amp; Engineering Association (MSEA) serves a large number of students on the Berkeley campus, including many non-majors, who know that a future in the materials disciplines is an enticing career option. Officers in MSEA sponsor both scholarly and social events to broaden undergraduates’ experiences here, and through a professional connection called Materials Advantage, students can join four national materials societies to launch their professional careers early.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students in the department are also highly respected members of several engineering student projects because of the materials issues involved. These include the Solar Car (CalSol) project, the Formula SAE race car team, the Human Powered Vehicle team, the Supermileage Vehicle team, and others offering deep immersion in actual engineering design and construction of a functional product. For students interested in shaping a carbon-fiber skin component or welding a 6061 aluminum alloy roll bar component, there are many opportunities to learn these and other valuable skills as a student in MSE.</p>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> <br/>
Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
<br/>
•<br/>
Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
•<br/>
Understanding of the origin of surface forces and interfacial free energy, and how they contribute to the development of the biomaterial interface and ultimately biomaterial performance.<br/></p></div>

<p>Materials Scientists and Engineers are involved in every aspect of technology, ranging from the design of materials appropriate for use in integrated circuits and biological applications to those materials needed for energy generation (both conventional energy sources and green sources) and for building bridges, roads, and buildings.</p>
<p>Upon graduation, students are prepared for a number of different careers paths. Many go on to graduate studies at prestigious universities. Others head directly into the workforce as engineers in Silicon Valley, the biotechnology sector, the aerospace or automotive fields, and energy-related industries.</p>
<p><span>The objectives of the undergraduate program in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) are to educate graduates who have the following skills:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>Knowledge of the fundamental science and engineering principles relevant to materials design, development and engineering application</li>
	<li>Understanding of the relationship between nano/microstructure, characterization, properties and processing and design of materials</li>
	<li>Have the experimental and computational skills for a professional career or graduate study in materials</li>
	<li>Possess a knowledge of the significance of research, the value of continued learning, and environmental/social issues surrounding materials</li>
	<li>Ability to communicate effectively, to work in teams, and to assume positions as leaders</li>
</ul>
<p>This major program leads to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the College. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there few, if any, spaces that open in the College each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Five-Year BS/MS Program</h3>
<p>The five-year combined Bachelor of Science/Master of Science program augments the existing four-year undergraduate program with a fifth year of graduate study that provides a professionally oriented component, preparing students for careers in engineering or engineering management within the business, government, and/or industrial sectors. In this program, students earn a bachelor's degree and subsequently, a Master of Science degree under Plan II (without thesis) of the Academic Senate. This five-year program emphasizes interdisciplinary study through an independent project coupled to coursework. The program is open to undergraduate materials science and engineering majors (both single or joint majors) only. For further information regarding this program, please see the <a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/undergrad/five-year">department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor in Materials Science and Engineering that is open to all students who are not majoring in MSE and who have completed the necessary prerequisites. To be eligible for the program, students are required to have a minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses. For information regarding the prerequisites, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>To apply for the minor, submit the <a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/mse-minor-petition-version-8.24.16.pdf">Petition for Admission to the Undergraduate Minor</a> to the undergraduate adviser after completion of the prerequisite courses. Upon completion of the minor requirements, submit a <a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/MSE-confirmation-of-completion-for-Minor-Version-8.24.16.pdf">Petition for Completion of the Undergraduate Minor</a> to the undergraduate adviser.</p>
<h3>Joint Majors</h3>
<p>The Department of Materials Science and Engineering also offers four joint majors, with other departments in the College of Engineering, and one joint major with a department in the College of Chemistry. For further information on these programs, please see the links below:<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>

You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement.

				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
<p>There is nothing more tangible in engineering products than the materials of which they are made, and this fact dominates the research agenda in materials science &amp; engineering around the world. At Berkeley, research programs in new materials synthesis, processing, characterization, integration, and theoretical modeling dominate the laboratory space and multiple servers dedicated to basic and applied research programs in the department, including many that are conducted at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Undergraduate students are strongly encouraged to meet with the many faculty members in the department who sponsor student research projects and learn about the many exciting options available to them. Sometimes a new student’s research experience begins by shadowing a senior graduate student to learn the ropes, but sometimes the project is fully unique, and exclusively theirs! Undergraduate students can earn units for their research efforts by enrolling in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MAT%20SCI%20199" title="MAT SCI 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MAT SCI 199');">MAT SCI 199</a></span>, which is offered on a <em>Pass/No Pass</em> basis. Another option is an honors thesis project, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MAT%20SCI%20H194" title="MAT SCI H194" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MAT SCI H194');">MAT SCI H194</a></span>, offered to qualified students as a graded course, which can therefore be counted as an upper division technical elective. There are also a number of paid research positions, especially over the summer. Students should not be shy about asking and should consider adding materials research to their undergraduate experience at Berkeley.</p>

<h3>Student Groups and Organizations</h3>
<p>The Materials Science &amp; Engineering Association (MSEA) serves a large number of students on the Berkeley campus, including many non-majors, who know that a future in the materials disciplines is an enticing career option. Officers in MSEA sponsor both scholarly and social events to broaden undergraduates’ experiences here, and through a professional connection called Materials Advantage, students can join four national materials societies to launch their professional careers early.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students in the department are also highly respected members of several engineering student projects because of the materials issues involved. These include the Solar Car (CalSol) project, the Formula SAE race car team, the Human Powered Vehicle team, the Supermileage Vehicle team, and others offering deep immersion in actual engineering design and construction of a functional product. For students interested in shaping a carbon-fiber skin component or welding a 6061 aluminum alloy roll bar component, there are many opportunities to learn these and other valuable skills as a student in MSE.</p>

This course is intended to give students the opportunity to expand their knowledge of topics related to biomedical materials selection and design. Structure-property relationships of biomedical materials and their interaction with biological systems will be addressed. Applications of the concepts developed include blood-materials compatibility, biomimetic materials, hard and soft tissue-materials interactions, drug delivery, tissue engineering</span><span class="deschide">, and biotechnology.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> <br/>
Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
<br/>
•<br/>
Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
•<br/>
Understanding of the origin of surface forces and interfacial free energy, and how they contribute to the development of the biomaterial interface and ultimately biomaterial performance.<br/></p></div>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>Materials Scientists and Engineers are involved in every aspect of technology, ranging from the design of materials appropriate for use in integrated circuits and biological applications to those materials needed for energy generation (both conventional energy sources and green sources) and for building bridges, roads, and buildings.</p>
<p>Upon graduation, students are prepared for a number of different careers paths. Many go on to graduate studies at prestigious universities. Others head directly into the workforce as engineers in Silicon Valley, the biotechnology sector, the aerospace or automotive fields, and energy-related industries.</p>
<p><span>The objectives of the undergraduate program in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) are to educate graduates who have the following skills:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>Knowledge of the fundamental science and engineering principles relevant to materials design, development and engineering application</li>
	<li>Understanding of the relationship between nano/microstructure, characterization, properties and processing and design of materials</li>
	<li>Have the experimental and computational skills for a professional career or graduate study in materials</li>
	<li>Possess a knowledge of the significance of research, the value of continued learning, and environmental/social issues surrounding materials</li>
	<li>Ability to communicate effectively, to work in teams, and to assume positions as leaders</li>
</ul>
<p>This major program leads to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the College. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there few, if any, spaces that open in the College each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Five-Year BS/MS Program</h3>
<p>The five-year combined Bachelor of Science/Master of Science program augments the existing four-year undergraduate program with a fifth year of graduate study that provides a professionally oriented component, preparing students for careers in engineering or engineering management within the business, government, and/or industrial sectors. In this program, students earn a bachelor's degree and subsequently, a Master of Science degree under Plan II (without thesis) of the Academic Senate. This five-year program emphasizes interdisciplinary study through an independent project coupled to coursework. The program is open to undergraduate materials science and engineering majors (both single or joint majors) only. For further information regarding this program, please see the <a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/undergrad/five-year">department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor in Materials Science and Engineering that is open to all students who are not majoring in MSE and who have completed the necessary prerequisites. To be eligible for the program, students are required to have a minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses. For information regarding the prerequisites, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>To apply for the minor, submit the <a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/mse-minor-petition-version-8.24.16.pdf">Petition for Admission to the Undergraduate Minor</a> to the undergraduate adviser after completion of the prerequisite courses. Upon completion of the minor requirements, submit a <a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/MSE-confirmation-of-completion-for-Minor-Version-8.24.16.pdf">Petition for Completion of the Undergraduate Minor</a> to the undergraduate adviser.</p>
<h3>Joint Majors</h3>
<p>The Department of Materials Science and Engineering also offers four joint majors, with other departments in the College of Engineering, and one joint major with a department in the College of Chemistry. For further information on these programs, please see the links below:<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>

				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
<p>There is nothing more tangible in engineering products than the materials of which they are made, and this fact dominates the research agenda in materials science &amp; engineering around the world. At Berkeley, research programs in new materials synthesis, processing, characterization, integration, and theoretical modeling dominate the laboratory space and multiple servers dedicated to basic and applied research programs in the department, including many that are conducted at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Undergraduate students are strongly encouraged to meet with the many faculty members in the department who sponsor student research projects and learn about the many exciting options available to them. Sometimes a new student’s research experience begins by shadowing a senior graduate student to learn the ropes, but sometimes the project is fully unique, and exclusively theirs! Undergraduate students can earn units for their research efforts by enrolling in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MAT%20SCI%20199" title="MAT SCI 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MAT SCI 199');">MAT SCI 199</a></span>, which is offered on a <em>Pass/No Pass</em> basis. Another option is an honors thesis project, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MAT%20SCI%20H194" title="MAT SCI H194" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MAT SCI H194');">MAT SCI H194</a></span>, offered to qualified students as a graded course, which can therefore be counted as an upper division technical elective. There are also a number of paid research positions, especially over the summer. Students should not be shy about asking and should consider adding materials research to their undergraduate experience at Berkeley.</p>

<h3>Student Groups and Organizations</h3>
<p>The Materials Science &amp; Engineering Association (MSEA) serves a large number of students on the Berkeley campus, including many non-majors, who know that a future in the materials disciplines is an enticing career option. Officers in MSEA sponsor both scholarly and social events to broaden undergraduates’ experiences here, and through a professional connection called Materials Advantage, students can join four national materials societies to launch their professional careers early.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students in the department are also highly respected members of several engineering student projects because of the materials issues involved. These include the Solar Car (CalSol) project, the Formula SAE race car team, the Human Powered Vehicle team, the Supermileage Vehicle team, and others offering deep immersion in actual engineering design and construction of a functional product. For students interested in shaping a carbon-fiber skin component or welding a 6061 aluminum alloy roll bar component, there are many opportunities to learn these and other valuable skills as a student in MSE.</p>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> <br/>
Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
<br/>
•<br/>
Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
•<br/>
Understanding of the origin of surface forces and interfacial free energy, and how they contribute to the development of the biomaterial interface and ultimately biomaterial performance.<br/></p></div>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>Materials Scientists and Engineers are involved in every aspect of technology, ranging from the design of materials appropriate for use in integrated circuits and biological applications to those materials needed for energy generation (both conventional energy sources and green sources) and for building bridges, roads, and buildings.</p>
<p>Upon graduation, students are prepared for a number of different careers paths. Many go on to graduate studies at prestigious universities. Others head directly into the workforce as engineers in Silicon Valley, the biotechnology sector, the aerospace or automotive fields, and energy-related industries.</p>
<p><span>The objectives of the undergraduate program in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) are to educate graduates who have the following skills:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>Knowledge of the fundamental science and engineering principles relevant to materials design, development and engineering application</li>
	<li>Understanding of the relationship between nano/microstructure, characterization, properties and processing and design of materials</li>
	<li>Have the experimental and computational skills for a professional career or graduate study in materials</li>
	<li>Possess a knowledge of the significance of research, the value of continued learning, and environmental/social issues surrounding materials</li>
	<li>Ability to communicate effectively, to work in teams, and to assume positions as leaders</li>
</ul>
<p>This major program leads to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the College. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there few, if any, spaces that open in the College each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Five-Year BS/MS Program</h3>
<p>The five-year combined Bachelor of Science/Master of Science program augments the existing four-year undergraduate program with a fifth year of graduate study that provides a professionally oriented component, preparing students for careers in engineering or engineering management within the business, government, and/or industrial sectors. In this program, students earn a bachelor's degree and subsequently, a Master of Science degree under Plan II (without thesis) of the Academic Senate. This five-year program emphasizes interdisciplinary study through an independent project coupled to coursework. The program is open to undergraduate materials science and engineering majors (both single or joint majors) only. For further information regarding this program, please see the <a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/undergrad/five-year">department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor in Materials Science and Engineering that is open to all students who are not majoring in MSE and who have completed the necessary prerequisites. To be eligible for the program, students are required to have a minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses. For information regarding the prerequisites, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>To apply for the minor, submit the <a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/mse-minor-petition-version-8.24.16.pdf">Petition for Admission to the Undergraduate Minor</a> to the undergraduate adviser after completion of the prerequisite courses. Upon completion of the minor requirements, submit a <a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/MSE-confirmation-of-completion-for-Minor-Version-8.24.16.pdf">Petition for Completion of the Undergraduate Minor</a> to the undergraduate adviser.</p>
<h3>Joint Majors</h3>
<p>The Department of Materials Science and Engineering also offers four joint majors, with other departments in the College of Engineering, and one joint major with a department in the College of Chemistry. For further information on these programs, please see the links below:<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>

You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework.

				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
<p>There is nothing more tangible in engineering products than the materials of which they are made, and this fact dominates the research agenda in materials science &amp; engineering around the world. At Berkeley, research programs in new materials synthesis, processing, characterization, integration, and theoretical modeling dominate the laboratory space and multiple servers dedicated to basic and applied research programs in the department, including many that are conducted at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Undergraduate students are strongly encouraged to meet with the many faculty members in the department who sponsor student research projects and learn about the many exciting options available to them. Sometimes a new student’s research experience begins by shadowing a senior graduate student to learn the ropes, but sometimes the project is fully unique, and exclusively theirs! Undergraduate students can earn units for their research efforts by enrolling in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MAT%20SCI%20199" title="MAT SCI 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MAT SCI 199');">MAT SCI 199</a></span>, which is offered on a <em>Pass/No Pass</em> basis. Another option is an honors thesis project, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MAT%20SCI%20H194" title="MAT SCI H194" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MAT SCI H194');">MAT SCI H194</a></span>, offered to qualified students as a graded course, which can therefore be counted as an upper division technical elective. There are also a number of paid research positions, especially over the summer. Students should not be shy about asking and should consider adding materials research to their undergraduate experience at Berkeley.</p>

<h3>Student Groups and Organizations</h3>
<p>The Materials Science &amp; Engineering Association (MSEA) serves a large number of students on the Berkeley campus, including many non-majors, who know that a future in the materials disciplines is an enticing career option. Officers in MSEA sponsor both scholarly and social events to broaden undergraduates’ experiences here, and through a professional connection called Materials Advantage, students can join four national materials societies to launch their professional careers early.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students in the department are also highly respected members of several engineering student projects because of the materials issues involved. These include the Solar Car (CalSol) project, the Formula SAE race car team, the Human Powered Vehicle team, the Supermileage Vehicle team, and others offering deep immersion in actual engineering design and construction of a functional product. For students interested in shaping a carbon-fiber skin component or welding a 6061 aluminum alloy roll bar component, there are many opportunities to learn these and other valuable skills as a student in MSE.</p>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> <br/>
Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
<br/>
•<br/>
Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
•<br/>
Understanding of the origin of surface forces and interfacial free energy, and how they contribute to the development of the biomaterial interface and ultimately biomaterial performance.<br/></p></div>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>Materials Scientists and Engineers are involved in every aspect of technology, ranging from the design of materials appropriate for use in integrated circuits and biological applications to those materials needed for energy generation (both conventional energy sources and green sources) and for building bridges, roads, and buildings.</p>
<p>Upon graduation, students are prepared for a number of different careers paths. Many go on to graduate studies at prestigious universities. Others head directly into the workforce as engineers in Silicon Valley, the biotechnology sector, the aerospace or automotive fields, and energy-related industries.</p>
<p><span>The objectives of the undergraduate program in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) are to educate graduates who have the following skills:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>Knowledge of the fundamental science and engineering principles relevant to materials design, development and engineering application</li>
	<li>Understanding of the relationship between nano/microstructure, characterization, properties and processing and design of materials</li>
	<li>Have the experimental and computational skills for a professional career or graduate study in materials</li>
	<li>Possess a knowledge of the significance of research, the value of continued learning, and environmental/social issues surrounding materials</li>
	<li>Ability to communicate effectively, to work in teams, and to assume positions as leaders</li>
</ul>
<p>This major program leads to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the College. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there few, if any, spaces that open in the College each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Five-Year BS/MS Program</h3>
<p>The five-year combined Bachelor of Science/Master of Science program augments the existing four-year undergraduate program with a fifth year of graduate study that provides a professionally oriented component, preparing students for careers in engineering or engineering management within the business, government, and/or industrial sectors. In this program, students earn a bachelor's degree and subsequently, a Master of Science degree under Plan II (without thesis) of the Academic Senate. This five-year program emphasizes interdisciplinary study through an independent project coupled to coursework. The program is open to undergraduate materials science and engineering majors (both single or joint majors) only. For further information regarding this program, please see the <a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/undergrad/five-year">department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor in Materials Science and Engineering that is open to all students who are not majoring in MSE and who have completed the necessary prerequisites. To be eligible for the program, students are required to have a minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses. For information regarding the prerequisites, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>To apply for the minor, submit the <a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/mse-minor-petition-version-8.24.16.pdf">Petition for Admission to the Undergraduate Minor</a> to the undergraduate adviser after completion of the prerequisite courses. Upon completion of the minor requirements, submit a <a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/MSE-confirmation-of-completion-for-Minor-Version-8.24.16.pdf">Petition for Completion of the Undergraduate Minor</a> to the undergraduate adviser.</p>
<h3>Joint Majors</h3>
<p>The Department of Materials Science and Engineering also offers four joint majors, with other departments in the College of Engineering, and one joint major with a department in the College of Chemistry. For further information on these programs, please see the links below:<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement.

				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
<p>There is nothing more tangible in engineering products than the materials of which they are made, and this fact dominates the research agenda in materials science &amp; engineering around the world. At Berkeley, research programs in new materials synthesis, processing, characterization, integration, and theoretical modeling dominate the laboratory space and multiple servers dedicated to basic and applied research programs in the department, including many that are conducted at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Undergraduate students are strongly encouraged to meet with the many faculty members in the department who sponsor student research projects and learn about the many exciting options available to them. Sometimes a new student’s research experience begins by shadowing a senior graduate student to learn the ropes, but sometimes the project is fully unique, and exclusively theirs! Undergraduate students can earn units for their research efforts by enrolling in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MAT%20SCI%20199" title="MAT SCI 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MAT SCI 199');">MAT SCI 199</a></span>, which is offered on a <em>Pass/No Pass</em> basis. Another option is an honors thesis project, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MAT%20SCI%20H194" title="MAT SCI H194" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MAT SCI H194');">MAT SCI H194</a></span>, offered to qualified students as a graded course, which can therefore be counted as an upper division technical elective. There are also a number of paid research positions, especially over the summer. Students should not be shy about asking and should consider adding materials research to their undergraduate experience at Berkeley.</p>

<h3>Student Groups and Organizations</h3>
<p>The Materials Science &amp; Engineering Association (MSEA) serves a large number of students on the Berkeley campus, including many non-majors, who know that a future in the materials disciplines is an enticing career option. Officers in MSEA sponsor both scholarly and social events to broaden undergraduates’ experiences here, and through a professional connection called Materials Advantage, students can join four national materials societies to launch their professional careers early.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students in the department are also highly respected members of several engineering student projects because of the materials issues involved. These include the Solar Car (CalSol) project, the Formula SAE race car team, the Human Powered Vehicle team, the Supermileage Vehicle team, and others offering deep immersion in actual engineering design and construction of a functional product. For students interested in shaping a carbon-fiber skin component or welding a 6061 aluminum alloy roll bar component, there are many opportunities to learn these and other valuable skills as a student in MSE.</p>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> <br/>
Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
<br/>
•<br/>
Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
