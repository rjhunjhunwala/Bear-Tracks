<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/entry-level-writing-requirement/">Entry Level Writing</a></p>
<p>All students who enter the University of California as freshmen must demonstrate their command of the English language by fulfilling the Entry Level Writing Requirement. Fulfillment of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all reading and composition courses at UC Berkeley. </p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-history-institutions-requirement/">American History and American Institutions</a></p>
<p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a US resident who graduates from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Campus Requirement</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-cultures-requirement/">American Cultures</a></p>
<p>American Cultures (AC) is the one requirement that all undergraduate students at UC Berkeley need to take and pass in order to graduate. The requirement offers an exciting intellectual environment centered on the study of race, ethnicity, and culture of the United States. AC courses offer students opportunities to be part of research-led, highly accomplished teaching environments, grappling with the complexity of American culture.</p>
<p><strong>M.E.T. Program Requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reading and Composition</strong></p>
<p>Two Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) courses must be taken for a letter grade (C- or better required), and must be completed by no later than the end of the sophomore year (4th semester of enrollment). The first half of R&amp;C, the “A” course, must be completed by the end of the freshman year; the second half of R&amp;C, the “B “course, by no later than the end of the sophomore year or a student's registration will be blocked. View a <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/reading-composition-requirement/">detailed list of courses </a>that fulfill Reading and Composition requirements. </p>
<p><strong>Breadth Requirement</strong></p>
<p>The undergraduate breadth requirement provides Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program. As the foundation of a liberal arts education, breadth courses give students a view into the intellectual life of the University while introducing them to a multitude of perspectives and approaches to research and scholarship. Engaging students in new disciplines and with peers from other majors, the breadth experience strengthens interdisciplinary connections and context that prepare Berkeley graduates to understand and solve the complex issues of their day.</p>
<p>Students in the M.E.T. Program must successfully complete six breadth courses, one in each of the following categories:</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Arts and Literature</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Historical Studies</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">International Studies</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Philosophy and Values (will be satisfied with UGBA 107)</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Physical Science (will be satisfied with Physics 7B)</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Social and Behavioral Sciences (will be satisfied with Econ 1)</p>
<ul>
	<li>With the exception of UGBA 107, UGBA courses cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>With the exception of Econ 1, microeconomics and macroeconomics at any level (Econ 2, Econ 3, Econ 100A/B, Econ 101A/B, IAS 106/107) cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses offered by any Engineering department, with the exception of BIO ENG 100, COMPSCI C79, ENGIN 125, 157AC, MEC ENG 191K and 191AC, cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>No more than two courses from any one department may be used to satisfy the breadth requirement (<a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">L&amp;S Discovery courses</a> are exempt).</li>
	<li>Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate exams cannot be used to fulfill the breadth requirement. Some A-Level exams are accepted, but a maximum of two A-Level exams may be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>Two of the breadth courses must be upper-division (courses numbered 100-196).</li>
	<li>Courses numbered 97, 98, 99, or above 196 may not be used to complete any breadth requirement.</li>
	<li>Breadth courses must be a minimum of 3 semester units.</li>
	<li>Reading &amp; Composition courses cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class Schedule Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Minimum units per semester: 13</li>
	<li>Maximum units per semester:  20.5</li>
	<li>Students in the M.E.T. Program must enroll each semester in no fewer than two technical courses (of a minimum of 3 units each) required of the engineering major program of study in which the student is officially declared.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minimum Academic (Grade) Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>A minimum overall and semester grade point average of 2.000 (C average) is required. Students will be subject to dismissal from the University if during any fall or spring semester their overall U.C. GPA falls below a 2.000, or their semester GPA is less than 2.000. </li>
	<li>Students must achieve a minimum GPA of 2.000 (C average) in upper division technical courses each semester. Students will be subject to dismissal from the University if their upper division technical GPA falls below 2.000. </li>
	<li>A minimum overall GPA of 2.000, and a minimum 2.000 GPA in upper division technical course work required of the major are required to graduate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unit Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>A minimum of 120 units are required to graduate.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) will count towards the 120 units; a maximum of four are allowed in a given semester.</li>
	<li>A maximum of four units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-f2d5c92a-7fff-0969-280b-137af48c1ccf">Passed grades may account for no more than one-third of the total units completed at UC Berkeley, Fall Program for Freshmen (FPF), UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), or UC Berkeley Washington Program (UCDC) toward the 120 overall minimum unit requirement. Transfer credit is not factored into the limit. This includes transfer units from outside of the UC system, other UC campuses, credit-bearing exams, as well as UC Berkeley Extension XB units.</span></li>

This is an introductory course on the finite element method and is intended for seniors in engineering and applied science disciplines. The course covers the basic topics of finite element technology, including domain discretization, polynomial interpolation, application of boundary conditions, assembly of global arrays, and solution of the resulting algebraic systems. Finite element formulations for several important field equations are introduced</span><span class="deschide"> using both direct and integral approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on computer simulation and analysis of realistic engineering problems from solid and fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetism. The course uses FEMLAB, a multiphysics MATLAB-based finite element program that possesses a wide array of modeling capabilities and is ideally suited for instruction. Assignments will involve both paper- and computer-based exercises. Computer-based assignments will emphasize the practical aspects of finite element model construction and analysis.</span><br/>

The course is designed to cover advanced corporate finance issues. Its purpose is two-fold. First, it will help students develop a tool-box, both conceptual and quantitative, to address real-world corporate financial issues that they will likely use immediately in any finance-related career. Second, the course is designed to give the “the big picture,” i.e., sharpen understanding of how corporate financial</span><span class="deschide"> strategy helps increase a firm’s value in a dynamic environment. The course examines qualitative factors that help determine financial strategy, including the costs of financial distress and the value of financial flexibility, as well as quantitative techniques, such as option pricing, that will be helpful in various analyses.</span><br/>

Consumer psychology</span><span class="deschide"> is the systematic study of how consumers perceive information, how they encode it in memory, integrate it with other sources of information, retrieve it from memory, and utilize it to make decisions.

This is a project-based course in collaborative innovation where students experience group creativity and team-based design by using techniques from across the disciplines of business, theater, design, and art practice. Students will leverage problem framing and solving techniques derived from critical thinking, systems thinking, and creative problem solving (popularly known today as design thinking). The course is grounded</span><span class="deschide"> in a brief weekly lecture that sets out the theoretical, historical, and cultural contexts for particular innovation practices, but the majority of the class involves hands-on studio-based learning guided by an interdisciplinary team of teachers leading small group collaborative projects.</span><br/>

This course covers the methods and applications of impact evaluations, which is the science of measuring the causal impact of a program or policy on outcomes of interest. At its essence, impact evaluation is about generating evidence on which policies work, and which don’t. This subject matter should appeal to three main audiences: (1) those in decision-making positions, such as policy makers and business leaders, and</span><span class="deschide"> need to consume the information generated from impact evaluations to make informed evidence-based decisions, (2) project managers, development practitioners and business managers who commission impact evaluations and (3) researchers who actually design and implement impact evaluations.</span><br/>

Energy is one of the main drivers of civilization. Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use. Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed</span><span class="deschide"> world. On the other hand, we must completely overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution. Are these shifts truly within our reach? Can we achieve both simultaneously? If so, how? This Big Ideas course will grapple with these questions using an interdisciplinary systems approach.</span><br/>

<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/entry-level-writing-requirement/">Entry Level Writing</a></p>
<p>All students who enter the University of California as freshmen must demonstrate their command of the English language by fulfilling the Entry Level Writing Requirement. Fulfillment of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all reading and composition courses at UC Berkeley. </p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-history-institutions-requirement/">American History and American Institutions</a></p>
<p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a US resident who graduates from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Campus Requirement</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-cultures-requirement/">American Cultures</a></p>
<p>American Cultures (AC) is the one requirement that all undergraduate students at UC Berkeley need to take and pass in order to graduate. The requirement offers an exciting intellectual environment centered on the study of race, ethnicity, and culture of the United States. AC courses offer students opportunities to be part of research-led, highly accomplished teaching environments, grappling with the complexity of American culture.</p>
<p><strong>M.E.T. Program Requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reading and Composition</strong></p>
<p>Two Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) courses must be taken for a letter grade (C- or better required), and must be completed by no later than the end of the sophomore year (4th semester of enrollment). The first half of R&amp;C, the “A” course, must be completed by the end of the freshman year; the second half of R&amp;C, the “B “course, by no later than the end of the sophomore year or a student's registration will be blocked. View a <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/reading-composition-requirement/">detailed list of courses </a>that fulfill Reading and Composition requirements. </p>
<p><strong>Breadth Requirement</strong></p>
<p>The undergraduate breadth requirement provides Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program. As the foundation of a liberal arts education, breadth courses give students a view into the intellectual life of the University while introducing them to a multitude of perspectives and approaches to research and scholarship. Engaging students in new disciplines and with peers from other majors, the breadth experience strengthens interdisciplinary connections and context that prepare Berkeley graduates to understand and solve the complex issues of their day.</p>
<p>Students in the M.E.T. Program must successfully complete six breadth courses, one in each of the following categories:</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Arts and Literature</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Historical Studies</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">International Studies</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Philosophy and Values (will be satisfied with UGBA 107)</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">Social and Behavioral Sciences (will be satisfied with Econ 1)</p>
<ul>
	<li>With the exception of UGBA 107, UGBA courses cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>With the exception of Econ 1, microeconomics and macroeconomics at any level (Econ 2, Econ 3, Econ 100A/B, Econ 101A/B, IAS 106/107) cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses offered by any Engineering department, with the exception of BIO ENG 100, COMPSCI C79, ENGIN 125, 157AC, MEC ENG 191K and 191AC, cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>No more than two courses from any one department may be used to satisfy the breadth requirement (<a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">L&amp;S Discovery courses</a> are exempt).</li>
	<li>Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate exams cannot be used to fulfill the breadth requirement. Some A-Level exams are accepted, but a maximum of two A-Level exams may be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>Two of the breadth courses must be upper-division (courses numbered 100-196).</li>
	<li>Courses numbered 97, 98, 99, or above 196 may not be used to complete any breadth requirement.</li>
	<li>Breadth courses must be a minimum of 3 semester units.</li>
	<li>Reading &amp; Composition courses cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
</ul>

	<li>A minimum overall and semester grade point average of 2.000 (C average) is required. Students will be subject to dismissal from the University if during any fall or spring semester their overall U.C. GPA falls below a 2.000, or their semester GPA is less than 2.000. </li>
	<li>Students must achieve a minimum GPA of 2.000 (C average) in upper division technical courses each semester. Students will be subject to dismissal from the University if their upper division technical GPA falls below 2.000. </li>
	<li>A minimum overall GPA of 2.000, and a minimum 2.000 GPA in upper division technical course work required of the major are required to graduate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unit Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>A minimum of 120 units are required to graduate.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) will count towards the 120 units; a maximum of four are allowed in a given semester.</li>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement. These courses focus upon how the diversity of America's constituent cultural traditions have shaped and continue to shape American identity and experience.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Visit the </span><a href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a> or the <a href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/">American Cultures website</a> for the specific American Cultures courses offered each semester. For a complete list of approved American Cultures courses at UC Berkeley and California Community Colleges, please see the <a href="https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/amcult">American Cultures Subcommittee’s website</a>. See your academic adviser if you have questions about your responsibility to satisfy the American Cultures breadth requirement.</p>

This is an introductory course on the finite element method and is intended for seniors in engineering and applied science disciplines. The course covers the basic topics of finite element technology, including domain discretization, polynomial interpolation, application of boundary conditions, assembly of global arrays, and solution of the resulting algebraic systems. Finite element formulations for several important field equations are introduced</span><span class="deschide"> using both direct and integral approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on computer simulation and analysis of realistic engineering problems from solid and fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetism. The course uses FEMLAB, a multiphysics MATLAB-based finite element program that possesses a wide array of modeling capabilities and is ideally suited for instruction. Assignments will involve both paper- and computer-based exercises. Computer-based assignments will emphasize the practical aspects of finite element model construction and analysis.</span><br/>

First, it will help students develop a tool-box, both conceptual and quantitative, to address real-world corporate financial issues that they will likely use immediately in any finance-related career. Second, the course is designed to give the “the big picture,” i.e., sharpen understanding of how corporate financial</span><span class="deschide"> strategy helps increase a firm’s value in a dynamic environment. The course examines qualitative factors that help determine financial strategy, including the costs of financial distress and the value of financial flexibility, as well as quantitative techniques, such as option pricing, that will be helpful in various analyses.</span><br/>

Consumer behavior is the study of how consumers process information, form attitudes and judgments, and make decisions. Its study is critical to understand how consumers think and behave, which is critical for a company wishing to develop a customer focus. Given how different people are, it is amazing how similarly their minds work. Consumer psychology</span><span class="deschide"> is the systematic study of how consumers perceive information, how they encode it in memory, integrate it with other sources of information, retrieve it from memory, and utilize it to make decisions. It is one of the building blocks of the study of marketing and provides the student with a set of tools with diverse applications.</span><br/>

Energy is one of the main drivers of civilization. Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use. Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed</span><span class="deschide"> world. On the other hand, we must completely overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution. Are these shifts truly within our reach? Can we achieve both simultaneously? If so, how? This Big Ideas course will grapple with these questions using an interdisciplinary systems approach.</span><br/>

Do you have an idea for a new business, but want to learn how to more fully develop this idea? Would you like to receive funding for your business idea, but lack a framework to ask for capital?

Through the planning process that tightly links market and financial planning a business plan creates a set of standards to which investors and teammates can evaluate actual performance, laying the foundation for an “operating plan” once the business is launched.</span><br/>

<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/entry-level-writing-requirement/">Entry Level Writing</a></p>
<p>All students who enter the University of California as freshmen must demonstrate their command of the English language by fulfilling the Entry Level Writing Requirement. Fulfillment of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all reading and composition courses at UC Berkeley. </p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-history-institutions-requirement/">American History and American Institutions</a></p>
<p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a US resident who graduates from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Campus Requirement</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-cultures-requirement/">American Cultures</a></p>
<p>American Cultures (AC) is the one requirement that all undergraduate students at UC Berkeley need to take and pass in order to graduate. The requirement offers an exciting intellectual environment centered on the study of race, ethnicity, and culture of the United States. AC courses offer students opportunities to be part of research-led, highly accomplished teaching environments, grappling with the complexity of American culture.</p>
<p><strong>M.E.T. Program Requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reading and Composition</strong></p>
<p>Two Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) courses must be taken for a letter grade (C- or better required), and must be completed by no later than the end of the sophomore year (4th semester of enrollment). The first half of R&amp;C, the “A” course, must be completed by the end of the freshman year; the second half of R&amp;C, the “B “course, by no later than the end of the sophomore year or a student's registration will be blocked. View a <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/reading-composition-requirement/">detailed list of courses </a>that fulfill Reading and Composition requirements. </p>
<p><strong>Breadth Requirement</strong></p>
<p>The undergraduate breadth requirement provides Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program. As the foundation of a liberal arts education, breadth courses give students a view into the intellectual life of the University while introducing them to a multitude of perspectives and approaches to research and scholarship. Engaging students in new disciplines and with peers from other majors, the breadth experience strengthens interdisciplinary connections and context that prepare Berkeley graduates to understand and solve the complex issues of their day.</p>
<p>Students in the M.E.T. Program must successfully complete six breadth courses, one in each of the following categories:</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Arts and Literature</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Historical Studies</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">International Studies</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Philosophy and Values (will be satisfied with UGBA 107)</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Physical Science (will be satisfied with Physics 7B)</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Social and Behavioral Sciences (will be satisfied with Econ 1)</p>
<ul>
	<li>With the exception of UGBA 107, UGBA courses cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>With the exception of Econ 1, microeconomics and macroeconomics at any level (Econ 2, Econ 3, Econ 100A/B, Econ 101A/B, IAS 106/107) cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses offered by any Engineering department, with the exception of BIO ENG 100, COMPSCI C79, ENGIN 125, 157AC, MEC ENG 191K and 191AC, cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>No more than two courses from any one department may be used to satisfy the breadth requirement (<a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">L&amp;S Discovery courses</a> are exempt).</li>
	<li>Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate exams cannot be used to fulfill the breadth requirement. Some A-Level exams are accepted, but a maximum of two A-Level exams may be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>Two of the breadth courses must be upper-division (courses numbered 100-196).</li>
	<li>Courses numbered 97, 98, 99, or above 196 may not be used to complete any breadth requirement.</li>
	<li>Breadth courses must be a minimum of 3 semester units.</li>
	<li>Reading &amp; Composition courses cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class Schedule Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Minimum units per semester: 13</li>
	<li>Maximum units per semester:  20.5</li>
	<li>Students in the M.E.T. Program must enroll each semester in no fewer than two technical courses (of a minimum of 3 units each) required of the engineering major program of study in which the student is officially declared.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minimum Academic (Grade) Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>A minimum overall and semester grade point average of 2.000 (C average) is required. Students will be subject to dismissal from the University if during any fall or spring semester their overall U.C. GPA falls below a 2.000, or their semester GPA is less than 2.000. </li>
	<li>Students must achieve a minimum GPA of 2.000 (C average) in upper division technical courses each semester. Students will be subject to dismissal from the University if their upper division technical GPA falls below 2.000. </li>
	<li>A minimum overall GPA of 2.000, and a minimum 2.000 GPA in upper division technical course work required of the major are required to graduate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unit Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>A minimum of 120 units are required to graduate.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) will count towards the 120 units; a maximum of four are allowed in a given semester.</li>
	<li>A maximum of four units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-f2d5c92a-7fff-0969-280b-137af48c1ccf">Passed grades may account for no more than one-third of the total units completed at UC Berkeley, Fall Program for Freshmen (FPF), UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), or UC Berkeley Washington Program (UCDC) toward the 120 overall minimum unit requirement. Transfer credit is not factored into the limit. This includes transfer units from outside of the UC system, other UC campuses, credit-bearing exams, as well as UC Berkeley Extension XB units.</span></li>

This is an introductory course on the finite element method and is intended for seniors in engineering and applied science disciplines. The course covers the basic topics of finite element technology, including domain discretization, polynomial interpolation, application of boundary conditions, assembly of global arrays, and solution of the resulting algebraic systems. Finite element formulations for several important field equations are introduced</span><span class="deschide"> using both direct and integral approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on computer simulation and analysis of realistic engineering problems from solid and fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetism. The course uses FEMLAB, a multiphysics MATLAB-based finite element program that possesses a wide array of modeling capabilities and is ideally suited for instruction. Assignments will involve both paper- and computer-based exercises. Computer-based assignments will emphasize the practical aspects of finite element model construction and analysis.</span><br/>

First, it will help students develop a tool-box, both conceptual and quantitative, to address real-world corporate financial issues that they will likely use immediately in any finance-related career. Second, the course is designed to give the “the big picture,” i.e., sharpen understanding of how corporate financial</span><span class="deschide"> strategy helps increase a firm’s value in a dynamic environment. The course examines qualitative factors that help determine financial strategy, including the costs of financial distress and the value of financial flexibility, as well as quantitative techniques, such as option pricing, that will be helpful in various analyses.</span><br/>

Consumer behavior is the study of how consumers process information, form attitudes and judgments, and make decisions. Its study is critical to understand how consumers think and behave, which is critical for a company wishing to develop a customer focus. Given how different people are, it is amazing how similarly their minds work. Consumer psychology</span><span class="deschide"> is the systematic study of how consumers perceive information, how they encode it in memory, integrate it with other sources of information, retrieve it from memory, and utilize it to make decisions. It is one of the building blocks of the study of marketing and provides the student with a set of tools with diverse applications.</span><br/>

This course—a mixture of lectures, readings, business cases and corporate speakers—uses theory, frameworks, tools and business cases to teach students how to systematically evaluate and implement sustainability strategies that also maintain or maximize financial returns. Students are taught to identify opportunities to create business value from environmental and social challenges, and to evaluate</span><span class="deschide"> the competitive implications related to sustainability initiatives. What type of long-term strategies can organizations set to simultaneously foster sustainable development strategy and sound financial practice? How should decision makers make trade-offs between these two organizational objectives? When is “sustainability” also “good business”?</span><br/>

Energy is one of the main drivers of civilization. Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use. Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed</span><span class="deschide"> world. On the other hand, we must completely overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution. Are these shifts truly within our reach? Can we achieve both simultaneously? If so, how? This Big Ideas course will grapple with these questions using an interdisciplinary systems approach.</span><br/>

<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/entry-level-writing-requirement/">Entry Level Writing</a></p>
<p>All students who enter the University of California as freshmen must demonstrate their command of the English language by fulfilling the Entry Level Writing Requirement. Fulfillment of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all reading and composition courses at UC Berkeley. </p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-history-institutions-requirement/">American History and American Institutions</a></p>
<p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a US resident who graduates from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Campus Requirement</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-cultures-requirement/">American Cultures</a></p>
<p>American Cultures (AC) is the one requirement that all undergraduate students at UC Berkeley need to take and pass in order to graduate. The requirement offers an exciting intellectual environment centered on the study of race, ethnicity, and culture of the United States. AC courses offer students opportunities to be part of research-led, highly accomplished teaching environments, grappling with the complexity of American culture.</p>
<p><strong>M.E.T. Program Requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reading and Composition</strong></p>
<p>Two Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) courses must be taken for a letter grade (C- or better required), and must be completed by no later than the end of the sophomore year (4th semester of enrollment). The first half of R&amp;C, the “A” course, must be completed by the end of the freshman year; the second half of R&amp;C, the “B “course, by no later than the end of the sophomore year or a student's registration will be blocked. View a <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/reading-composition-requirement/">detailed list of courses </a>that fulfill Reading and Composition requirements. </p>
<p><strong>Breadth Requirement</strong></p>
<p>The undergraduate breadth requirement provides Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program. As the foundation of a liberal arts education, breadth courses give students a view into the intellectual life of the University while introducing them to a multitude of perspectives and approaches to research and scholarship. Engaging students in new disciplines and with peers from other majors, the breadth experience strengthens interdisciplinary connections and context that prepare Berkeley graduates to understand and solve the complex issues of their day.</p>
<p>Students in the M.E.T. Program must successfully complete six breadth courses, one in each of the following categories:</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Arts and Literature</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Historical Studies</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">International Studies</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Philosophy and Values (will be satisfied with UGBA 107)</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Physical Science (will be satisfied with Physics 7B)</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Social and Behavioral Sciences (will be satisfied with Econ 1)</p>
<ul>
	<li>With the exception of UGBA 107, UGBA courses cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>With the exception of Econ 1, microeconomics and macroeconomics at any level (Econ 2, Econ 3, Econ 100A/B, Econ 101A/B, IAS 106/107) cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses offered by any Engineering department, with the exception of BIO ENG 100, COMPSCI C79, ENGIN 125, 157AC, MEC ENG 191K and 191AC, cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>No more than two courses from any one department may be used to satisfy the breadth requirement (<a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">L&amp;S Discovery courses</a> are exempt).</li>
	<li>Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate exams cannot be used to fulfill the breadth requirement. Some A-Level exams are accepted, but a maximum of two A-Level exams may be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>Two of the breadth courses must be upper-division (courses numbered 100-196).</li>
	<li>Courses numbered 97, 98, 99, or above 196 may not be used to complete any breadth requirement.</li>
	<li>Breadth courses must be a minimum of 3 semester units.</li>
	<li>Reading &amp; Composition courses cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class Schedule Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Minimum units per semester: 13</li>
	<li>Maximum units per semester:  20.5</li>
	<li>Students in the M.E.T. Program must enroll each semester in no fewer than two technical courses (of a minimum of 3 units each) required of the engineering major program of study in which the student is officially declared.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minimum Academic (Grade) Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>A minimum overall and semester grade point average of 2.000 (C average) is required. Students will be subject to dismissal from the University if during any fall or spring semester their overall U.C. GPA falls below a 2.000, or their semester GPA is less than 2.000. </li>
	<li>Students must achieve a minimum GPA of 2.000 (C average) in upper division technical courses each semester. Students will be subject to dismissal from the University if their upper division technical GPA falls below 2.000. </li>
	<li>A minimum overall GPA of 2.000, and a minimum 2.000 GPA in upper division technical course work required of the major are required to graduate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unit Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>A minimum of 120 units are required to graduate.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) will count towards the 120 units; a maximum of four are allowed in a given semester.</li>
	<li>A maximum of four units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-f2d5c92a-7fff-0969-280b-137af48c1ccf">Passed grades may account for no more than one-third of the total units completed at UC Berkeley, Fall Program for Freshmen (FPF), UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), or UC Berkeley Washington Program (UCDC) toward the 120 overall minimum unit requirement. Transfer credit is not factored into the limit. This includes transfer units from outside of the UC system, other UC campuses, credit-bearing exams, as well as UC Berkeley Extension XB units.</span></li>

This is an introductory course on the finite element method and is intended for seniors in engineering and applied science disciplines. The course covers the basic topics of finite element technology, including domain discretization, polynomial interpolation, application of boundary conditions, assembly of global arrays, and solution of the resulting algebraic systems. Finite element formulations for several important field equations are introduced</span><span class="deschide"> using both direct and integral approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on computer simulation and analysis of realistic engineering problems from solid and fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetism. The course uses FEMLAB, a multiphysics MATLAB-based finite element program that possesses a wide array of modeling capabilities and is ideally suited for instruction. Assignments will involve both paper- and computer-based exercises. Computer-based assignments will emphasize the practical aspects of finite element model construction and analysis.</span><br/>

The course is designed to cover advanced corporate finance issues. Its purpose is two-fold. First, it will help students develop a tool-box, both conceptual and quantitative, to address real-world corporate financial issues that they will likely use immediately in any finance-related career. Second, the course is designed to give the “the big picture,” i.e., sharpen understanding of how corporate financial</span><span class="deschide"> strategy helps increase a firm’s value in a dynamic environment. The course examines qualitative factors that help determine financial strategy, including the costs of financial distress and the value of financial flexibility, as well as quantitative techniques, such as option pricing, that will be helpful in various analyses.</span><br/>

This is a project-based course in collaborative innovation where students experience group creativity and team-based design by using techniques from across the disciplines of business, theater, design, and art practice.

The course is grounded</span><span class="deschide"> in a brief weekly lecture that sets out the theoretical, historical, and cultural contexts for particular innovation practices, but the majority of the class involves hands-on studio-based learning guided by an interdisciplinary team of teachers leading small group collaborative projects.</span><br/>

This course covers the methods and applications of impact evaluations, which is the science of measuring the causal impact of a program or policy on outcomes of interest. At its essence, impact evaluation is about generating evidence on which policies work, and which don’t. This subject matter should appeal to three main audiences: (1) those in decision-making positions, such as policy makers and business leaders, and</span><span class="deschide"> need to consume the information generated from impact evaluations to make informed evidence-based decisions, (2) project managers, development practitioners and business managers who commission impact evaluations and (3) researchers who actually design and implement impact evaluations.</span><br/>

Energy is one of the main drivers of civilization. Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use. Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed</span><span class="deschide"> world. On the other hand, we must completely overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution. Are these shifts truly within our reach? Can we achieve both simultaneously? If so, how? This Big Ideas course will grapple with these questions using an interdisciplinary systems approach.</span><br/>

<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/entry-level-writing-requirement/">Entry Level Writing</a></p>
<p>All students who enter the University of California as freshmen must demonstrate their command of the English language by fulfilling the Entry Level Writing Requirement. Fulfillment of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all reading and composition courses at UC Berkeley. </p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-history-institutions-requirement/">American History and American Institutions</a></p>
<p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a US resident who graduates from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Campus Requirement</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-cultures-requirement/">American Cultures</a></p>
<p>American Cultures (AC) is the one requirement that all undergraduate students at UC Berkeley need to take and pass in order to graduate. The requirement offers an exciting intellectual environment centered on the study of race, ethnicity, and culture of the United States. AC courses offer students opportunities to be part of research-led, highly accomplished teaching environments, grappling with the complexity of American culture.</p>
<p><strong>M.E.T. Program Requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reading and Composition</strong></p>
<p>Two Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) courses must be taken for a letter grade (C- or better required), and must be completed by no later than the end of the sophomore year (4th semester of enrollment). The first half of R&amp;C, the “A” course, must be completed by the end of the freshman year; the second half of R&amp;C, the “B “course, by no later than the end of the sophomore year or a student's registration will be blocked. View a <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/reading-composition-requirement/">detailed list of courses </a>that fulfill Reading and Composition requirements. </p>
<p><strong>Breadth Requirement</strong></p>
<p>The undergraduate breadth requirement provides Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program. As the foundation of a liberal arts education, breadth courses give students a view into the intellectual life of the University while introducing them to a multitude of perspectives and approaches to research and scholarship. Engaging students in new disciplines and with peers from other majors, the breadth experience strengthens interdisciplinary connections and context that prepare Berkeley graduates to understand and solve the complex issues of their day.</p>
<p>Students in the M.E.T. Program must successfully complete six breadth courses, one in each of the following categories:</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Arts and Literature</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Historical Studies</p>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement. These courses focus upon how the diversity of America's constituent cultural traditions have shaped and continue to shape American identity and experience.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Visit the </span><a href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a> or the <a href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/">American Cultures website</a> for the specific American Cultures courses offered each semester. For a complete list of approved American Cultures courses at UC Berkeley and California Community Colleges, please see the <a href="https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/amcult">American Cultures Subcommittee’s website</a>. See your academic adviser if you have questions about your responsibility to satisfy the American Cultures breadth requirement.</p>

This is an introductory course on the finite element method and is intended for seniors in engineering and applied science disciplines. The course covers the basic topics of finite element technology, including domain discretization, polynomial interpolation, application of boundary conditions, assembly of global arrays, and solution of the resulting algebraic systems. Finite element formulations for several important field equations are introduced</span><span class="deschide"> using both direct and integral approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on computer simulation and analysis of realistic engineering problems from solid and fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetism. The course uses FEMLAB, a multiphysics MATLAB-based finite element program that possesses a wide array of modeling capabilities and is ideally suited for instruction. Assignments will involve both paper- and computer-based exercises. Computer-based assignments will emphasize the practical aspects of finite element model construction and analysis.</span><br/>

First, it will help students develop a tool-box, both conceptual and quantitative, to address real-world corporate financial issues that they will likely use immediately in any finance-related career. Second, the course is designed to give the “the big picture,” i.e., sharpen understanding of how corporate financial</span><span class="deschide"> strategy helps increase a firm’s value in a dynamic environment. The course examines qualitative factors that help determine financial strategy, including the costs of financial distress and the value of financial flexibility, as well as quantitative techniques, such as option pricing, that will be helpful in various analyses.</span><br/>

Consumer behavior is the study of how consumers process information, form attitudes and judgments, and make decisions. Its study is critical to understand how consumers think and behave, which is critical for a company wishing to develop a customer focus.

Consumer psychology</span><span class="deschide"> is the systematic study of how consumers perceive information, how they encode it in memory, integrate it with other sources of information, retrieve it from memory, and utilize it to make decisions.

Energy is one of the main drivers of civilization. Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use. Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed</span><span class="deschide"> world. On the other hand, we must completely overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution. Are these shifts truly within our reach? Can we achieve both simultaneously? If so, how? This Big Ideas course will grapple with these questions using an interdisciplinary systems approach.</span><br/>
