				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Near Eastern Languages and Literatures major offers study in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and the ancient Egyptian language. The major introduces<span> students to the peoples, cultures, and histories of the Middle East. Language courses are designed to enhance the student's command of reading, writing, speaking, and comprehension as well as provide students with specialized language skills and expertise that are vital for the global economy. They are often essential preparation for graduate programs too. Students in this major may choose one of the following emphases:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span>An emphasis in a modern language: </span><strong><span>Arabic, </span><span>Hebrew, or </span><span>Persian</span></strong></li>
	<li><span>An emphasis in an ancient language: <strong>Egyptology</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>The department <span>offers modern language instruction at </span>elementary to advanced levels <span>in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Turkish (minor only). </span>Instructors are trained in contemporary teaching methods, using the latest classroom technologies and a range of multi-media tools to provide engaging and exciting classroom instruction. The major is intended to <span>help students prepare for travel abroad or for a </span><span>career that requires language fluency. A </span><span>major in the Near Eastern languages allow students to be </span><span>part of a close-knit group of language enthusiasts and </span><span>ensures that each student will receive the </span><span>best </span>training for their future goals. <span>The major prepares students for professions in </span><span>foreign service, political and </span><span>international affairs, comparative studies, translation services, teaching and research, and for </span><span>further study in graduate programs</span>.</p>
<p><span>For specific information regarding degree requirements for each emphasis, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page. </span>Please note the Egyptology major is currently under review for updates and revisions. For more information about Egyptology major requirements, please contact the undergraduate major advisor. </p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students are recommended to declare the major early in their academic careers. Near Eastern Studies 10 is a required lower division course, which may be taken after declaring the major. Students should consult with the undergraduate student advisor regarding major requirements, transfer credits, study abroad plans, and the opportunity to combine two disciplines through a double major study.  </p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students in any of the Near Eastern Studies majors, with an overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 or higher and a GPA of 3.51 or higher in courses completed in the major, may apply for admission to the honors program in their senior year. Students must maintain the required GPA in the major in order to remain eligible for the honors program. </p>
<p>In addition to the GPA requirement, students must submit an honors thesis of at least 20 double-spaced, typewritten pages in their senior year. Students are required to enroll in an Independent Study course (NES 199) in the fall semester and the honors course (<a href="/search/?P=NE%20STUD%20H195">NE STUD H195</a>) in the spring semester of their senior year in order to receive credit for the thesis. The honors thesis must be read and evaluated by a two-member committee consisting of a department faculty thesis supervisor and another member of the faculty. The thesis must be deemed to be of at least B+ quality in order to qualify the candidate for graduation with a degree of honors. Students may also receive distinctions of &quot;high honors&quot; or &quot;highest honors&quot; for outstanding thesis papers. </p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Near Eastern Studies Department also offers programs leading to a minor in modern Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Turkish, or Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern Civilizations. </p>

The course focuses on ancient astronomy from Babylonia to the Greco-Roman world. Readings from primary texts, including Babylonian astronomical and astrological documents (MUL.APIN, Enuma Anu Enlil, etc.) and Greek treatises such as Geminos= Introduction to the Phenomena and Ptolemy's Almagest are used. Problems of the calendar and of planetary motion are of special interest. Two different approaches to celestial phenomena are covered, one from</span><span class="deschide"> cuneiform texts, predominantly arithmetical and linear and the other from hellenistic Greek antiquity, characteristically geometrical and introducing a quantitative dimension only after contact with and borrowing from Babylonian astronomy.</span><br/>

The most famous of Babylonian heroes is Gilgamesh, King of Uruk. The Gilgamesh Epic, recorded on twelve tablets in cuneiform, follows him in his quest for fame and eternal life. In this course, we will read the Gilgamesh Epic as well as several earlier texts around the same character. Moreover, we will read additional ancient texts that elucidate one or another aspect of the Epic. We will follow the traditions around Gilgamesh and see how his fame</span><span class="deschide"> was used for literary, religious, and political purposes. Finally, we will look at some of the modern Gilgamesh interpretations.</span><br/>

Today, much of the information we gather on any topic comes from Internet sources. Goal of this class is to increase students' skills in critically evaluating the scholarly value of information on the Ancient Near East that is to be found in web pages, e-journals, and online books. We will consider the goal and context of sources of information (touristic, commercial, scholarly, religious, etc.) and how this influences and filters the information</span><span class="deschide"> provided. Although the class will focus on Internet resources, we will not neglect to use the same critical eye when using print media. The class will feature a number of collaborative projects in which this critical attitude may be practiced.</span><br/>

This course examines the social and religious lives of women and men through the lens of the law. A major concern is the relationship between law and culture, namely, the ways in which the law reflected ideals and tensions ranging from ideological competition between states to the problems of ordinary townspeople and peasants. In analyzing actual court cases, we will ask how individuals participated in the life of the court, and how they used the court to articulate</span><span class="deschide"> their own self-interest and sense of moral worth. Readings will be in English. Students wishing to work with sources in the original Ottoman Turkish should also enroll in Turkish 104 (1 unit).</span><br/>
