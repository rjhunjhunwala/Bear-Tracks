				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Students who major in Integrative Biology (IB) will gain a broad and deep knowledge in the biological sciences as well as an excellent foundation in the biology of organisms, populations, and communities. This program may be of particular interest to students who wish to pursue graduate studies in any of these research areas. It also provides superb training for students interested in health-related professions (medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, physical therapy, nursing, pharmacy, optometry, etc.) or careers incorporating biology (psychology, sociobiology, forestry, wildlife conservation, environmental and resource management, law, etc.).</p>
<p>The department's broad range of experts includes behaviorists, ecologists, evolutionary biologists, geneticists, morphologists, paleontologists, physiologists, and systematists. </p>
<h3>Course of Study Overview</h3>
<p>Students majoring in Integrative Biology choose one of two emphases: <span>Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology (Emphasis 1) or Integrative Human Biology (Emphasis 2). The lower division requirements are the same for all IB students, regardless of the emphasis. The upper division requirements differ slightly for the two emphases, but all students take lecture and lab or field lab classes from IB's three groups: Evolution and Genetics; Ecology, Behavior, and Biodiversity; Structure, Function, and Human Health. For detailed information, please see the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/integrative-biology/#majorrequirementstext">Major Requirements tab</a>.</span></p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>In order to declare Integrative Biology as a major, students must have completed certain prerequisites. For information regarding these courses, please see the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/integrative-biology/#majorrequirementstext">Major Requirements tab</a>. Students must have at least a 2.0 GPA (1.) overall, (2.) in all courses for the major, and (3.) in all upper-division courses for the major. All declaring students must meet with a staff advisor and a faculty advisor as part of the declaration process.</p>
<p><span>At the time of declaration, students must have completed:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span>One year of calculus, either <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MATH%201A" title="MATH 1A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 1A');">MATH 1A</a></span></span>

</li>

</ul>

<p>For transfer students, it is recommended that lower division courses be completed before arriving at Berkeley. All declaring students must be able to complete the major requirements in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="http://ib.berkeley.edu/undergrad/major/declaring.php" target="_blank">department's website</a> for detailed instructions to declare the IB major.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with minimum grade point averages (GPA) of 3.3 overall and in the major are encouraged to participate in the honors program. Interested students must identify an appropriate faculty sponsor who agrees to advise them on an original research project and enroll in two consecutive semesters of the honors thesis course (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=INTEGBI%20H196A" title="INTEGBI H196A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'INTEGBI H196A');">INTEGBI H196A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=INTEGBI%20H196B" title="INTEGBI H196B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'INTEGBI H196B');">INTEGBI H196B</a></span>). Honors students must present the results of their work in the form of a written honors thesis and a poster presentation at Cal Day. In order to graduate with honors, students must maintain the minimum required GPAs.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Integrative Biology.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://ib.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>
			</div>
			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the university, campus, and college requirements, listed on the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/integrative-biology/#collegerequirementstext">College Requirements tab</a>, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All major requirements must be taken for a letter grade.</li>
	<li>Standardized test credit (e.g., Advanced Placement) cannot be used to satisfy any major requirements.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs. Double majors and simultaneous degrees are limited to a two-course overlap. </li>
	<li>Students must maintain a minimum grade point average (GPA) of at least a 2.0 overall, a 2.0 GPA in the required major coursework (lower and upper division), and a 2.0 GPA in the upper division coursework for the major.</li>
	<li>A maximum of two upper division courses may be taken from outside the Department of Integrative Biology. This includes study abroad courses, as well as non-IB courses, even if they are on the approved electives list.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding breadth, residence requirements, and unit requirements, please see the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/integrative-biology/#collegerequirementstext">College Requirements tab</a>.</p>

				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><p><span>Integrative Biology offers three types of undergraduate advising: staff advisors, faculty advisors, and peer advisors. The advising office, located in 3060 Valley Life Sciences Building, is part of Biosciences Divisional Services (BDS), providing support for the Department of Integrative Biology and the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><u>BDS Student Services Mission Statement</u><br/>
We partner with faculty, staff, and students to create an inclusive academic community that offers holistic advising and innovative services to support educational success. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Staff Advisers</h3>
<p>Staff academic advisors are trained to support students and assist them in successfully completing their IB major. They are excellent resources for questions concerning administration and academics or finding out about other available services. Students should see a staff advisor for the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Questions about major requirements</li>
	<li>Advice about schedule planning</li>
	<li>Declaring the IB major</li>
	<li>Information about research opportunities, graduate and professional schools, career opportunities, scholarships, and internships</li>
	<li>Scheduling conflicts or registration holds</li>
	<li>Information and registration assistance for independent research credit</li>
	<li>General assistance or advice</li>
	<li>Information about upcoming events and programs</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff advisors are available for drop-in advising during open hours, found on the advising website: <a href="http://ib.berkeley.edu/undergrad" target="_blank">http://ib.berekeley.edu/undergrad</a>. Complex issues such as probation, academic difficulty, readmission, and major declaration are best discussed in an appointment. Continuing students can schedule an appointment via Cal Central.</p>
<p>The general advising email address is <a href="mailto:ibusso@berkeley.edu">ibusso@berkeley.edu</a>. This email is checked daily, Monday through Friday, so students will receive a timely answer to their questions.</p>
<h3>Faculty Advisers</h3>
<p>Faculty advisers are IB professors assigned to advise students about the IB department, courses, research, and other academic issues. Students meet with a faculty advisor when they declare the IB major. Students should see a faculty adviser for the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Guidance toward achieving academic and career goals</li>
	<li>Questions about the content of IB courses</li>
	<li>Questions about biological research and biology in general</li>
	<li>Recommendations on graduate training</li>
</ul>
<p>For a list of faculty advisors and their office hours, please speak with a staff advisor in 3060 VLSB or visit our website: <a href="http://ib.berkeley.edu/undergrad/advising.php" target="_blank">http://ib.berkeley.edu/undergrad/advising.php</a>. Faculty advisers are not available for office hours during instructional breaks, including summer break. Students may refer to staff drop-in advising hours during summer sessions and non-instructional periods.</p>
<h3>Peer Advisers</h3>
<p>Peer advisers are junior and senior IB students who volunteer their time to complement the advising services by sharing their knowledge of and experience with lower division requirements and upper division classes, experience with student groups on campus, preparation for life beyond Cal, and use of various campus resources. To see the schedule and more information about who the peer advisers are and which courses they have taken, visit their webpage: <a href="https://ib.berkeley.edu/undergrad/ibpeers" target="_blank">https://ib.berkeley.edu/undergrad/ibpeers</a>.</p>

Recent advances in genomic methodologies have further increased our appreciation of such contributions by highlighting the prevalence of organismal microbial communities and their complex interactions with their hosts. Through lectures and discussions,</span><span class="deschide"> IB 118 will consider the broad range of host-microbe interactions – from mutualism to pathogenesis, and from pairwise interactions to the microbiome - learning the principles that shape these interactions, the technologies used to interrogate them and the molecular mechanisms underlying them.</span><br/>

Mechanisms by which key physiological priorities are maintained in healthy humans. From a basis in elementary theories of information and control, we develop an understanding of homeostasis of cellular composition, structure, and energy metabolism. We then study neural and endocrine signaling in humans, and develop the key concepts of control and homeostasis in all the major organ and multi-organ systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory</span><span class="deschide">, renal, metabolic, reproductive, and immune systems, growth and development, and sensory and motor systems.</span><br/>

The primary goal of this course is to provide students with a broad understanding of the evolution of hormonal systems. A comparative approach allows us to envisage how the complex mammalian endocrine system presumably evolved from that of more primitive vertebrates. Students will learn about endocrine pathways and endocrine-based behaviors of jawless fishes, fishes, amphibia, reptiles, birds, and mammals. In addition, students will gain</span><span class="deschide"> an understanding of the experimental methods used in endocrine research. The class teaches students how to read and interpret the primary scientific literature; thus it encourages the critical thinking that is a fundamental skill for any scientist.</span><br/>

This course provides a comprehensive overview of behavorial endocrinology beginning with hormone production and actions on target issues and continuing with an exploration of a variety of behaviors and their hormonal regulation/consequences. The course uses a comparative approach to examine the reciprocal interactions between the neuroendocrine system and behavior, considering the effects of hormone on development and adult behavior in addition</span><span class="deschide"> to how behavior regulates endocrine physiology. While much of the course focuses on non-human vertebrate species, the relevance to humans is explored where appropriate.

This course explores the ways that evolutionary theory, natural selection, drift, genetics, and epigenetics can illuminate our understanding of human health and disease. The course begins with an overview of primate and hominid evolution and human genetic variation. We then evaluate reproductive biology and maternal/child health through an evolutionary lens. We explore how human ecosystem interactions influence diet, metabolic adaptations,</span><span class="deschide"> hematological adaptions, human microbiome, and human pathogens. We examine evolutionary concepts related to aging, senescence and development of cancer. Finally we study psychology, behavior, and social/cultural organization through an evolutionary perspective.</span><br/>

This course is a hands-on introduction to common research methods in population and community ecology. Each method and its application are first presented in a lecture session, illustrated with published examples. The method is then practiced in a subsequent group field exercise, conducted in a local terrestrial, aquatic, or marine habitat. The course focuses on sampling methods, experimental designs, and statistical analyses used to investigate</span><span class="deschide"> patterns of species distribution and abundance, interspecific associations, and local species diversity. Graded assignments include write-ups of field exercise results, and an in-depth review paper and oral in-class presentation on an ecological method of particular interest to the student.</span><br/>

The biological world is shaped by interactions among species. These inter-specific interactions, such as between predators and prey, plants and pollinators, or hosts and pathogens, have led to an impressive array of adaptations, helping to explain the incredible organismal and genetic diversity on Earth.

This course examines the history of human dispersal across Oceania from the perspectives of biogeography and evolutionary ecology. H. sapiens faced problems of dispersal, colonization, and extinction, and adapted in a variety of ways to the diversity of insular ecosystems. A dual evolutionary model takes into account cultural evolution and transmission, as well as biological evolution of human populations. This course also explores the impacts of human</span><span class="deschide"> populations on isolated and fragile insular ecosystems, and the reciprocal effects of anthropogenic change on human cultures.</span><br/>
