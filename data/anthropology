				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Anthropology major is designed to serve two purposes: to provide a general education in anthropology for students who are pursuing a liberal arts education and to provide preparation for graduate work for students who wish to become professional anthropologists. Students who do not intend to do graduate work in anthropology may plan their program with considerable freedom, so long as they fulfill the requirements of the major listed below. Students who plan to go on to graduate study, either at UC Berkeley or another institution, should select a combination of courses to form a unified plan of study that meets special intellectual interests.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Before you are eligible to declare the major, you must have completed or be in the progress of completing two of the three prerequisite courses and enrolled in the third, with a grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 or higher in all courses intended for the major. For more details regarding the prerequisites, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>To declare the major, you will need to complete these three steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Fill in completely the &quot;Application and Petition to Declare Major.&quot;</li>
	<li>Provide photocopies of transcripts showing courses satisfying the major prerequisites that you took anywhere other than Berkeley, with the grades you earned (continuing Berkeley students may request copies of their transfer transcripts from the Undergraduate Admissions Office in 110 Sproul Hall).</li>
	<li>Meet with the Academic Undergraduate Advisor in 215 Kroeber Hall during office hours.</li>
</ol>
<p>Declare the major as soon as you are eligible. You should declare the major no later than the beginning of your junior year; if you are a transfer student, you should declare the major during your first semester at UC Berkeley.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The honors program in Anthropology is an independently-pursued course of research undertaken by qualified students under the mentorship of a faculty thesis advisor. An overall GPA of 3.5 and a GPA of 3.65 in the major in courses completed at UC Berkeley is required to qualify for the program. The year-long senior program may begin in either the fall or spring semester. The program requires the sponsorship of an anthropology professor as an adviser and a second reader. The honors courses, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ANTHRO%20H195A" title="ANTHRO H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ANTHRO H195A');">ANTHRO H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ANTHRO%20H195B" title="ANTHRO H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ANTHRO H195B');">ANTHRO H195B</a></span>, may also count as elective requirements for the major. Applications and more information are available at 215 Kroeber Hall.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Anthropology offers an undergraduate minor in anthropology. In order to declare the minor, you will need to complete these three steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Complete the &quot;Petition for Confirmation of Minor Program Completion&quot; and the &quot;Minor Application Form.&quot;</li>
	<li>Provide photocopies of transcripts showing courses satisfying the minor that you took anywhere other than Berkeley, with the grades you earned (continuing Berkeley students may request copies of their transfer transcripts from the Undergraduate Admissions Office in 110 Sproul Hall).</li>
	<li>Submit all documentation to the Undergraduate Advising Office in 215 Kroeber.</li>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>

The course presents a diachronic perspective on human-fire interactions with local ecosystems in California that spans over 10,000 years. The course will provide an historical perspective on human-fire interactions at the landscape scale using a diverse range of data sources drawn from the fields of fire ecology, biology, history, anthropology, and archaeology. An important component includes examining how diverse cultures and ethnicity influenced how people</span><span class="deschide"> perceived and used fire at the landscape scale in ancient, historical and modern times. The implications of these diverse fire practices and policies will be analyzed and the consequences they have had for transforming habitats and propagating catastrophic fires will be explored.</span><br/>

This course examines the history of human dispersal across Oceania from the perspectives of biogeography and evolutionary ecology. H. sapiens faced problems of dispersal, colonization, and extinction, and adapted in a variety of ways to the diversity of insular ecosystems. A dual evolutionary model takes into account cultural evolution and transmission, as well as biological evolution of human populations. This course also explores the impacts of human</span><span class="deschide"> populations on isolated and fragile insular ecosystems, and the reciprocal effects of anthropogenic change on human cultures.</span><br/>

This class explores the questions: why study the archaeology of households? How do we define households and how can we identify and study them archaeologically? What research questions, strategies, and methodologies does the archaeological investigation of households entail? How does the study of households contribute to multiscalar approaches for understanding social organization? Why is this important?</span><span class="deschide"> What are the causes and effects of changing scales of analysis?</span><br/>

In the contemporary world, different systems of knowledge, philosophies, and techniques of the self, understandings of normality and pathology, illness and healing, are increasingly engaged in a dialogue with each other in the lives, on the bodies, and in the imagination of people. The terms of this dialogue are often unequal and painful, yet they are also productive of new subjectivities and new voices. It is the task of a renewed psychological</span><span class="deschide"> anthropology to study and reflect on these processes. Topics to be covered in this class include new forms of the subject and ethics at the intersection of psychical/psychiatric, political, and religious processes and discources; ethno-psychiatry, psychoanalysis, the psychology of colonization and racism; anthropological approaches to possession and altered states, emotion, culture, and the imagination, madness and mental illness. The specific stress will be on the stakes of anthropology of the psyche today, for an understanding of power and subjugation, delusion and the imagination, violence, and the possibility of new forms of life.</span><br/>

Modern times have been dominated by utopian visions of how to achieve a happy future society. Artists in competing social systems played a central role in the development of these visions. But artistic experiments were filled with paradoxes, contributing to the creation not only of the most liberating and progressive ideals and values but also to the most oppressive regimes and ideologies.

Disability is a cultural construct. This does not mean that physical and mental impairments are not real, but that our conceptions of the body and its possibilities and impossibilities are constantly mediated through social norms and mores. The built environments and social institutions we navigate are based around these concepts of the “normal.” Using ethnographic examples drawn from various countries around the world, and various disability</span><span class="deschide"> categories, we examine the contingency of the categories of disability and normality from social, legal, and personal perspectives.</span><br/>
