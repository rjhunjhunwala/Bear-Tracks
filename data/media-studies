				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p class="p1">The major applies perspectives from liberal arts disciplines in the social sciences and humanities to examine the central role that media plays in the economic, social, political, and cultural life of citizens in modern societies. Our emphasis in this major is historical and theoretical, examining media systems, institutions, policies, and practices. We offer students the analytical tools available to examine media—old and new, local to global—as well as media consumption and meaning-making processes.</p>
<p class="p1">The program weds traditions from communication, history, anthropology, sociology, and political science with critical and cultural studies theory to analyze and assess the role and meaning of media in contemporary societies.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students planning to declare a major in Media Studies are advised to read the Media Studies website in its entirety and then contact the student academic adviser as early as possible to discuss their academic program plans. Applications are accepted during fall and spring semesters during periods listed on <a href="http://mediastudies.ugis.berkeley.edu/">the program's website</a>.</p>

<h3>Upper Division Electives</h3>
<p>Students must complete five upper-division electives for the major, including at least one elective each from each of the following three groups:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Group A. History</li>
	<li>Group B: Specialization in a Medium</li>
	<li>Group C: Theory and Application</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the courses listed below are approved electives. This list is updated annually. Additional, prior to enrolling each term, Media Studies publishes a list of Current Courses. This list may include other courses that have been approved on a one-time basis–as electives for that semester only. The online archive will serve as a record of these course approvals.<br/>
Students wishing to have any other course reviewed as a possible elective for Media Studies must submit a copy of the course syllabus to a faculty adviser.</p>

<h3><span>Transfer Students</span></h3>
<p>Transfer students are urged to complete major prerequisite courses before arriving on campus. New transfers should see the major faculty adviser on arrival in order to have transfer prerequisites reviewed for approval if not on assist.org. Transfers may need assistance in adding Media Studies 10 to their schedules in fall 2019 and spring 2020 if they did not take an approved equivalent at another school. They may also take Media Studies N10 during the summer when offered.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Beginning fall 2020, all students planning to apply to the Media Studies major at the University of California, Berkeley MUST complete Media Studies 10 or N10 at UC Berkeley, in accordance with the policy approved Spring 2018. Any Media Studies 10 transfer course equivalents completed after summer 2020 will not satisfy the Media Studies 10 prerequisite requirement. Media Studies 10 or N10 must be completed before applying to the major.</span></p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p class="p1">The Media Studies major at the University of California at Berkeley is an undergraduate interdisciplinary group major in the Office of Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS). Courses taught by core faculty in Media Studies cover media history and theory with an emphasis on media systems, policy, and practices.  Additionally, faculty from multiple departments cross campus bring the perspectives and methods of their fields to bear on the analysis of media in a variety of elective courses.  Our emphasis in this major is historical and theoretical, offering students the analytical tools available to examine media—old and new, local to global—as well as media consumption and meaning-making processes.</p>
<p class="p2"><span>The three core courses examine media history, theory, institutions, and policy. We offer students the analytical tools available to examine media—old and new, local to global—as well as media consumption and meaning-making processes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span>In addition to the core courses, students must take an approved methods course in the social sciences and five approved elective courses, including at least one from each of these three groups: Group A: History; Group B: Specialization in a Medium; Group C: Theory and Application.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span>Core courses and electives offered by the Media Studies program—whether examining popular culture and entertainment, advertising, or news and information viewed on cinema, television, computer, or mobile phone screens—ask students to develop critical thinking and analytical skills. Students may also choose to take approved electives offered by other disciplines on campus including anthropology, English, history, linguistics, journalism, political science, and sociology to name a few.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span>Critical analysis in media studies involves identifying and evaluating evidence, understanding theoretical concepts and being able to apply them to new media materials or situations, and examining the relationships between words and images.</span></p>

In this course, students learn why sound journalism is so important to a healthy, working democracy. Journalism is rapidly changing. The class will give a context to those changes and provide an overview of comtemporary journalistic institutions. Students will examine how news is made, who decides what news is, who makes it, who profits by it, and what rules guide how reporters and editors work. Central issues affecting journalism, such as bias and professionalism</span><span class="deschide">, will be discussed. The class is not specifically intended for future journalists, but students will learn why pursuing a career in journalism can be so fulfilling and thrilling, as well as becoming better consumers of the news.</span><br/>

The history of journalism is a broad subject--far broader than can comprehensively be covered in a single course. So necessarily, this course takes an idiosyncratic approach. This course examines how news has been defined, discovered, and communicated from its early modern origins to the present. It will also focus on particular areas of journalism. The class will take a critical look at how wars get reported on, including the current war in</span><span class="deschide"> Iraq. The class will examine the role of journalists in the rise of the Cold War more than half a century ago. It will also examine the importance of media barons, by studying two highly readable biographies, one of William Randolph Hearst, the other of Katherine Graham. And finally, the class will look at the role journalists played in unseating President Nixon.</span><br/>

From there, we’ll look at the impact of the personal computer’s growth and the rise of proprietary dial-up online services.

We’ll focus</span><span class="deschide"> on key figures in technology and journalism who shaped the new medium, and trace how its growth undermined traditional economic models even as it enabled the rise of new ones, continuing through today’s world of mobile apps, aggregators and social media.</span><br/>

This course will familiarize you with the often-contentious history of media theory. At issue among scholars working within different theoretical and research traditions are core disagreements about what should be studied (institutions, texts, audiences, and/or technologies) and how media should be studied (for applied, “practical” purposes or with an eye that is critical of power and institutional structures). Course readings and lectures stress an understanding</span><span class="deschide"> of these various research traditions by focusing on the cultural, historical, political, and social contexts surrounding them, the research models and methods used, and the findings and conclusions reached.</span><br/>
