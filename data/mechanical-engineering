				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>Mechanical engineers serve society by solving problems in transportation, energy, the environment, and human health. The activity of mechanical engineers extends from the investigation of physical phenomena governing the behavior of our surroundings to the manufacture and evaluation of products. The mechanical engineering profession encompasses numerous technical areas, including acoustics, automatic control, bioengineering, combustion, cryogenics, design, dynamics, energy conversion, engines, environment, heat transfer, lubrication, mass transfer, manufacturing and sustainability, materials processing, mechanics of solids and fluids, mechanisms, plasma dynamics, propulsion, thermodynamics, vibration, and wave propagation.</p>
<p>The undergraduate program in mechanical engineering seeks to provide students with a broad education emphasizing an excellent foundation in scientific and engineering fundamentals. The objectives of the undergraduate program are to prepare undergraduate students for employment or advanced studies with four primary constituencies: industry, the national laboratories, state and federal agencies, and academia (graduate research programs).</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>Our programs are accredited by <a href="http://www.abet.org/accreditation/">ABET</a>, a non-profit and non-governmental accrediting agency for academic programs in the disciplines of applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology. ABET is a recognized accreditor in the United States (U.S.) by the <a href="http://www.chea.org/" title="Council for Higher Education Accreditation">Council for Higher Education Accreditation</a>. For information about how the program achieves ABET course outcomes, please see the <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-program/program-objectives-and-outcomes-abet">Department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates in the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few, if any, spaces that open in the college each year to students from other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Five-Year BS/MS Program</h3>
<p>This program is for Berkeley ME undergraduates who wish to broaden their education experiences at Berkeley. In contrast to the standard MS program, this BS/MS program is completely course-based. Students in the five-year BS/MS program are also able to take some courses in professional disciplines such as business or public policy. This two-semester program is not intended for students with the desire to continue to the PhD. For further information regarding this option, please see the <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/graduate/degree-programs/five-year-bsms-program">department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor program in Mechanical Engineering. For admission to the minor, students must have a minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 as well as a minimum 3.00 GPA in the prerequisite courses. For information regarding the prerequisites, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>After completion of the prerequisite courses, students will need to complete and submit to the Mechanical Engineering Student Services Office (Room 6189/6193 Etcheverry) a Petition for Admission form which can be found <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-program-requirements/me-minor-program">here</a>. The department will verify the completion of the minor and send the paperwork to the appropriate parties after final grades are available.</p>
<h3>Joint Majors</h3>
<p>The Department of Mechanical Engineering also offers two joint majors with other departments in the College of Engineering. For further information on these programs, please click the links below:<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement. These courses focus upon how the diversity of America's constituent cultural traditions have shaped and continue to shape American identity and experience.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Visit the </span><a href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a> or the <a href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/">American Cultures website</a> for the specific American Cultures courses offered each semester. For a complete list of approved American Cultures courses at UC Berkeley and California Community Colleges, please see the <a href="https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/amcult">American Cultures Subcommittee’s website</a>. See your academic adviser if you have questions about your responsibility to satisfy the American Cultures breadth requirement.</p>

				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><p>Students in Mechanical Engineering have a number of advising options, listed in sequential order:</p>
<h3>College of Engineering (COE)</h3>
<p>All undergraduates have an adviser at the College referred to as the Engineering Student Services (ESS) Advisor. ESS advisers assist students in a variety of ways including course selection (primarily for freshmen, sophomores and transfer students), explaining graduation requirements and college policies, monitoring progress toward the degree, suggesting enrichment opportunities, and providing support (or referrals to campus resources) to help students reach their academic goals. They are also the first stop for students who wish to file a petition. Advising assignments are made alphabetically. Students who are unsure of who their adviser is should refer to the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/advising/student-affairs-advising.html " target="_blank">COE's undergraduate advising information page</a>.</p>
<h3>ME Student Services Office</h3>
<p>This office is students' primary source of department-specific administrative information.</p>
<h3>ME Faculty Advisor</h3>
<p>Faculty advisers for new students will be assigned by the beginning of October and a listing will be available online. Faculty are great sources for information regarding classes, research opportunities, and career planning. Furthermore, all ME students are required to see their faculty advisers (or go to drop-in advising) to get their advising codes before signing up for the next semester's courses.</p>
<h3>Vice Chair for Undergraduate Matters</h3>
<p>The Vice Chair handles all undergraduate student petitions and can serve as a liaison between students and their respective advisors as well as students and the ME chair. He is also responsible for the ME undergraduate curriculum and heads the Committee on Undergraduate Study.</p>
<h3>Department Chair</h3>
<p>In rare instances when issues cannot be resolved by the Vice Chair, the Mechanical Engineering chair may become involved.</p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>Mechanical engineers serve society by solving problems in transportation, energy, the environment, and human health. The activity of mechanical engineers extends from the investigation of physical phenomena governing the behavior of our surroundings to the manufacture and evaluation of products. The mechanical engineering profession encompasses numerous technical areas, including acoustics, automatic control, bioengineering, combustion, cryogenics, design, dynamics, energy conversion, engines, environment, heat transfer, lubrication, mass transfer, manufacturing and sustainability, materials processing, mechanics of solids and fluids, mechanisms, plasma dynamics, propulsion, thermodynamics, vibration, and wave propagation.</p>
<p>The undergraduate program in mechanical engineering seeks to provide students with a broad education emphasizing an excellent foundation in scientific and engineering fundamentals. The objectives of the undergraduate program are to prepare undergraduate students for employment or advanced studies with four primary constituencies: industry, the national laboratories, state and federal agencies, and academia (graduate research programs).</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>Our programs are accredited by <a href="http://www.abet.org/accreditation/">ABET</a>, a non-profit and non-governmental accrediting agency for academic programs in the disciplines of applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology. ABET is a recognized accreditor in the United States (U.S.) by the <a href="http://www.chea.org/" title="Council for Higher Education Accreditation">Council for Higher Education Accreditation</a>. For information about how the program achieves ABET course outcomes, please see the <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-program/program-objectives-and-outcomes-abet">Department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates in the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few, if any, spaces that open in the college each year to students from other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Five-Year BS/MS Program</h3>
<p>This program is for Berkeley ME undergraduates who wish to broaden their education experiences at Berkeley. In contrast to the standard MS program, this BS/MS program is completely course-based. Students in the five-year BS/MS program are also able to take some courses in professional disciplines such as business or public policy. This two-semester program is not intended for students with the desire to continue to the PhD. For further information regarding this option, please see the <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/graduate/degree-programs/five-year-bsms-program">department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor program in Mechanical Engineering. For admission to the minor, students must have a minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 as well as a minimum 3.00 GPA in the prerequisite courses. For information regarding the prerequisites, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>After completion of the prerequisite courses, students will need to complete and submit to the Mechanical Engineering Student Services Office (Room 6189/6193 Etcheverry) a Petition for Admission form which can be found <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-program-requirements/me-minor-program">here</a>. The department will verify the completion of the minor and send the paperwork to the appropriate parties after final grades are available.</p>
<h3>Joint Majors</h3>
<p>The Department of Mechanical Engineering also offers two joint majors with other departments in the College of Engineering. For further information on these programs, please click the links below:<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement. These courses focus upon how the diversity of America's constituent cultural traditions have shaped and continue to shape American identity and experience.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Visit the </span><a href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a> or the <a href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/">American Cultures website</a> for the specific American Cultures courses offered each semester. For a complete list of approved American Cultures courses at UC Berkeley and California Community Colleges, please see the <a href="https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/amcult">American Cultures Subcommittee’s website</a>. See your academic adviser if you have questions about your responsibility to satisfy the American Cultures breadth requirement.</p>

				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><p>Students in Mechanical Engineering have a number of advising options, listed in sequential order:</p>
<h3>College of Engineering (COE)</h3>
<p>All undergraduates have an adviser at the College referred to as the Engineering Student Services (ESS) Advisor. ESS advisers assist students in a variety of ways including course selection (primarily for freshmen, sophomores and transfer students), explaining graduation requirements and college policies, monitoring progress toward the degree, suggesting enrichment opportunities, and providing support (or referrals to campus resources) to help students reach their academic goals. They are also the first stop for students who wish to file a petition. Advising assignments are made alphabetically. Students who are unsure of who their adviser is should refer to the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/advising/student-affairs-advising.html " target="_blank">COE's undergraduate advising information page</a>.</p>
<h3>ME Student Services Office</h3>
<p>This office is students' primary source of department-specific administrative information.</p>
<h3>ME Faculty Advisor</h3>
<p>Faculty advisers for new students will be assigned by the beginning of October and a listing will be available online. Faculty are great sources for information regarding classes, research opportunities, and career planning. Furthermore, all ME students are required to see their faculty advisers (or go to drop-in advising) to get their advising codes before signing up for the next semester's courses.</p>
<h3>Vice Chair for Undergraduate Matters</h3>
<p>The Vice Chair handles all undergraduate student petitions and can serve as a liaison between students and their respective advisors as well as students and the ME chair. He is also responsible for the ME undergraduate curriculum and heads the Committee on Undergraduate Study.</p>
<h3>Department Chair</h3>
<p>In rare instances when issues cannot be resolved by the Vice Chair, the Mechanical Engineering chair may become involved.</p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>Mechanical engineers serve society by solving problems in transportation, energy, the environment, and human health. The activity of mechanical engineers extends from the investigation of physical phenomena governing the behavior of our surroundings to the manufacture and evaluation of products. The mechanical engineering profession encompasses numerous technical areas, including acoustics, automatic control, bioengineering, combustion, cryogenics, design, dynamics, energy conversion, engines, environment, heat transfer, lubrication, mass transfer, manufacturing and sustainability, materials processing, mechanics of solids and fluids, mechanisms, plasma dynamics, propulsion, thermodynamics, vibration, and wave propagation.</p>
<p>The undergraduate program in mechanical engineering seeks to provide students with a broad education emphasizing an excellent foundation in scientific and engineering fundamentals. The objectives of the undergraduate program are to prepare undergraduate students for employment or advanced studies with four primary constituencies: industry, the national laboratories, state and federal agencies, and academia (graduate research programs).</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>Our programs are accredited by <a href="http://www.abet.org/accreditation/">ABET</a>, a non-profit and non-governmental accrediting agency for academic programs in the disciplines of applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology. ABET is a recognized accreditor in the United States (U.S.) by the <a href="http://www.chea.org/" title="Council for Higher Education Accreditation">Council for Higher Education Accreditation</a>. For information about how the program achieves ABET course outcomes, please see the <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-program/program-objectives-and-outcomes-abet">Department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates in the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few, if any, spaces that open in the college each year to students from other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Five-Year BS/MS Program</h3>
<p>This program is for Berkeley ME undergraduates who wish to broaden their education experiences at Berkeley. In contrast to the standard MS program, this BS/MS program is completely course-based. Students in the five-year BS/MS program are also able to take some courses in professional disciplines such as business or public policy. This two-semester program is not intended for students with the desire to continue to the PhD. For further information regarding this option, please see the <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/graduate/degree-programs/five-year-bsms-program">department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor program in Mechanical Engineering. For admission to the minor, students must have a minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 as well as a minimum 3.00 GPA in the prerequisite courses. For information regarding the prerequisites, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>After completion of the prerequisite courses, students will need to complete and submit to the Mechanical Engineering Student Services Office (Room 6189/6193 Etcheverry) a Petition for Admission form which can be found <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-program-requirements/me-minor-program">here</a>. The department will verify the completion of the minor and send the paperwork to the appropriate parties after final grades are available.</p>
<h3>Joint Majors</h3>
<p>The Department of Mechanical Engineering also offers two joint majors with other departments in the College of Engineering. For further information on these programs, please click the links below:<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement. These courses focus upon how the diversity of America's constituent cultural traditions have shaped and continue to shape American identity and experience.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Visit the </span><a href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a> or the <a href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/">American Cultures website</a> for the specific American Cultures courses offered each semester. For a complete list of approved American Cultures courses at UC Berkeley and California Community Colleges, please see the <a href="https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/amcult">American Cultures Subcommittee’s website</a>. See your academic adviser if you have questions about your responsibility to satisfy the American Cultures breadth requirement.</p>

				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><p>Students in Mechanical Engineering have a number of advising options, listed in sequential order:</p>
<h3>College of Engineering (COE)</h3>
<p>All undergraduates have an adviser at the College referred to as the Engineering Student Services (ESS) Advisor. ESS advisers assist students in a variety of ways including course selection (primarily for freshmen, sophomores and transfer students), explaining graduation requirements and college policies, monitoring progress toward the degree, suggesting enrichment opportunities, and providing support (or referrals to campus resources) to help students reach their academic goals. They are also the first stop for students who wish to file a petition. Advising assignments are made alphabetically. Students who are unsure of who their adviser is should refer to the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/advising/student-affairs-advising.html " target="_blank">COE's undergraduate advising information page</a>.</p>
<h3>ME Student Services Office</h3>
<p>This office is students' primary source of department-specific administrative information.</p>
<h3>ME Faculty Advisor</h3>
<p>Faculty advisers for new students will be assigned by the beginning of October and a listing will be available online. Faculty are great sources for information regarding classes, research opportunities, and career planning. Furthermore, all ME students are required to see their faculty advisers (or go to drop-in advising) to get their advising codes before signing up for the next semester's courses.</p>
<h3>Vice Chair for Undergraduate Matters</h3>
<p>The Vice Chair handles all undergraduate student petitions and can serve as a liaison between students and their respective advisors as well as students and the ME chair. He is also responsible for the ME undergraduate curriculum and heads the Committee on Undergraduate Study.</p>
<h3>Department Chair</h3>
<p>In rare instances when issues cannot be resolved by the Vice Chair, the Mechanical Engineering chair may become involved.</p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>Mechanical engineers serve society by solving problems in transportation, energy, the environment, and human health. The activity of mechanical engineers extends from the investigation of physical phenomena governing the behavior of our surroundings to the manufacture and evaluation of products. The mechanical engineering profession encompasses numerous technical areas, including acoustics, automatic control, bioengineering, combustion, cryogenics, design, dynamics, energy conversion, engines, environment, heat transfer, lubrication, mass transfer, manufacturing and sustainability, materials processing, mechanics of solids and fluids, mechanisms, plasma dynamics, propulsion, thermodynamics, vibration, and wave propagation.</p>
<p>The undergraduate program in mechanical engineering seeks to provide students with a broad education emphasizing an excellent foundation in scientific and engineering fundamentals. The objectives of the undergraduate program are to prepare undergraduate students for employment or advanced studies with four primary constituencies: industry, the national laboratories, state and federal agencies, and academia (graduate research programs).</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>Our programs are accredited by <a href="http://www.abet.org/accreditation/">ABET</a>, a non-profit and non-governmental accrediting agency for academic programs in the disciplines of applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology. ABET is a recognized accreditor in the United States (U.S.) by the <a href="http://www.chea.org/" title="Council for Higher Education Accreditation">Council for Higher Education Accreditation</a>. For information about how the program achieves ABET course outcomes, please see the <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-program/program-objectives-and-outcomes-abet">Department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates in the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few, if any, spaces that open in the college each year to students from other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Five-Year BS/MS Program</h3>
<p>This program is for Berkeley ME undergraduates who wish to broaden their education experiences at Berkeley. In contrast to the standard MS program, this BS/MS program is completely course-based. Students in the five-year BS/MS program are also able to take some courses in professional disciplines such as business or public policy. This two-semester program is not intended for students with the desire to continue to the PhD. For further information regarding this option, please see the <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/graduate/degree-programs/five-year-bsms-program">department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor program in Mechanical Engineering. For admission to the minor, students must have a minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 as well as a minimum 3.00 GPA in the prerequisite courses. For information regarding the prerequisites, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>After completion of the prerequisite courses, students will need to complete and submit to the Mechanical Engineering Student Services Office (Room 6189/6193 Etcheverry) a Petition for Admission form which can be found <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-program-requirements/me-minor-program">here</a>. The department will verify the completion of the minor and send the paperwork to the appropriate parties after final grades are available.</p>
<h3>Joint Majors</h3>
<p>The Department of Mechanical Engineering also offers two joint majors with other departments in the College of Engineering. For further information on these programs, please click the links below:<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement. These courses focus upon how the diversity of America's constituent cultural traditions have shaped and continue to shape American identity and experience.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Visit the </span><a href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a> or the <a href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/">American Cultures website</a> for the specific American Cultures courses offered each semester. For a complete list of approved American Cultures courses at UC Berkeley and California Community Colleges, please see the <a href="https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/amcult">American Cultures Subcommittee’s website</a>. See your academic adviser if you have questions about your responsibility to satisfy the American Cultures breadth requirement.</p>

				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><p>Students in Mechanical Engineering have a number of advising options, listed in sequential order:</p>
<h3>College of Engineering (COE)</h3>
<p>All undergraduates have an adviser at the College referred to as the Engineering Student Services (ESS) Advisor. ESS advisers assist students in a variety of ways including course selection (primarily for freshmen, sophomores and transfer students), explaining graduation requirements and college policies, monitoring progress toward the degree, suggesting enrichment opportunities, and providing support (or referrals to campus resources) to help students reach their academic goals. They are also the first stop for students who wish to file a petition. Advising assignments are made alphabetically. Students who are unsure of who their adviser is should refer to the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/advising/student-affairs-advising.html " target="_blank">COE's undergraduate advising information page</a>.</p>
<h3>ME Student Services Office</h3>
<p>This office is students' primary source of department-specific administrative information.</p>
<h3>ME Faculty Advisor</h3>
<p>Faculty advisers for new students will be assigned by the beginning of October and a listing will be available online. Faculty are great sources for information regarding classes, research opportunities, and career planning. Furthermore, all ME students are required to see their faculty advisers (or go to drop-in advising) to get their advising codes before signing up for the next semester's courses.</p>
<h3>Vice Chair for Undergraduate Matters</h3>
<p>The Vice Chair handles all undergraduate student petitions and can serve as a liaison between students and their respective advisors as well as students and the ME chair. He is also responsible for the ME undergraduate curriculum and heads the Committee on Undergraduate Study.</p>
<h3>Department Chair</h3>
<p>In rare instances when issues cannot be resolved by the Vice Chair, the Mechanical Engineering chair may become involved.</p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>Mechanical engineers serve society by solving problems in transportation, energy, the environment, and human health. The activity of mechanical engineers extends from the investigation of physical phenomena governing the behavior of our surroundings to the manufacture and evaluation of products. The mechanical engineering profession encompasses numerous technical areas, including acoustics, automatic control, bioengineering, combustion, cryogenics, design, dynamics, energy conversion, engines, environment, heat transfer, lubrication, mass transfer, manufacturing and sustainability, materials processing, mechanics of solids and fluids, mechanisms, plasma dynamics, propulsion, thermodynamics, vibration, and wave propagation.</p>
<p>The undergraduate program in mechanical engineering seeks to provide students with a broad education emphasizing an excellent foundation in scientific and engineering fundamentals. The objectives of the undergraduate program are to prepare undergraduate students for employment or advanced studies with four primary constituencies: industry, the national laboratories, state and federal agencies, and academia (graduate research programs).</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>Our programs are accredited by <a href="http://www.abet.org/accreditation/">ABET</a>, a non-profit and non-governmental accrediting agency for academic programs in the disciplines of applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology. ABET is a recognized accreditor in the United States (U.S.) by the <a href="http://www.chea.org/" title="Council for Higher Education Accreditation">Council for Higher Education Accreditation</a>. For information about how the program achieves ABET course outcomes, please see the <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-program/program-objectives-and-outcomes-abet">Department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates in the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few, if any, spaces that open in the college each year to students from other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Five-Year BS/MS Program</h3>
<p>This program is for Berkeley ME undergraduates who wish to broaden their education experiences at Berkeley. In contrast to the standard MS program, this BS/MS program is completely course-based. Students in the five-year BS/MS program are also able to take some courses in professional disciplines such as business or public policy. This two-semester program is not intended for students with the desire to continue to the PhD. For further information regarding this option, please see the <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/graduate/degree-programs/five-year-bsms-program">department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor program in Mechanical Engineering. For admission to the minor, students must have a minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 as well as a minimum 3.00 GPA in the prerequisite courses. For information regarding the prerequisites, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>After completion of the prerequisite courses, students will need to complete and submit to the Mechanical Engineering Student Services Office (Room 6189/6193 Etcheverry) a Petition for Admission form which can be found <a href="http://www.me.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-program-requirements/me-minor-program">here</a>. The department will verify the completion of the minor and send the paperwork to the appropriate parties after final grades are available.</p>
<h3>Joint Majors</h3>
<p>The Department of Mechanical Engineering also offers two joint majors with other departments in the College of Engineering. For further information on these programs, please click the links below:<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the prerequisite courses is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement. These courses focus upon how the diversity of America's constituent cultural traditions have shaped and continue to shape American identity and experience.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Visit the </span><a href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a> or the <a href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/">American Cultures website</a> for the specific American Cultures courses offered each semester. For a complete list of approved American Cultures courses at UC Berkeley and California Community Colleges, please see the <a href="https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/amcult">American Cultures Subcommittee’s website</a>. See your academic adviser if you have questions about your responsibility to satisfy the American Cultures breadth requirement.</p>

				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><p>Students in Mechanical Engineering have a number of advising options, listed in sequential order:</p>
<h3>College of Engineering (COE)</h3>
<p>All undergraduates have an adviser at the College referred to as the Engineering Student Services (ESS) Advisor. ESS advisers assist students in a variety of ways including course selection (primarily for freshmen, sophomores and transfer students), explaining graduation requirements and college policies, monitoring progress toward the degree, suggesting enrichment opportunities, and providing support (or referrals to campus resources) to help students reach their academic goals. They are also the first stop for students who wish to file a petition. Advising assignments are made alphabetically. Students who are unsure of who their adviser is should refer to the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/advising/student-affairs-advising.html " target="_blank">COE's undergraduate advising information page</a>.</p>
<h3>ME Student Services Office</h3>
<p>This office is students' primary source of department-specific administrative information.</p>
<h3>ME Faculty Advisor</h3>
<p>Faculty advisers for new students will be assigned by the beginning of October and a listing will be available online. Faculty are great sources for information regarding classes, research opportunities, and career planning. Furthermore, all ME students are required to see their faculty advisers (or go to drop-in advising) to get their advising codes before signing up for the next semester's courses.</p>
<h3>Vice Chair for Undergraduate Matters</h3>
<p>The Vice Chair handles all undergraduate student petitions and can serve as a liaison between students and their respective advisors as well as students and the ME chair. He is also responsible for the ME undergraduate curriculum and heads the Committee on Undergraduate Study.</p>
<h3>Department Chair</h3>
<p>In rare instances when issues cannot be resolved by the Vice Chair, the Mechanical Engineering chair may become involved.</p>
