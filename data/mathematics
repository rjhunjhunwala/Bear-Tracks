				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Department of Mathematics offers an undergraduate major program in mathematics, leading to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. Major programs within the department provide excellent preparation for advanced degrees in math, physical sciences, economics, and industrial engineering as well as graduate study in business, education, law, and medicine. They also prepare students for post-baccalaureate positions in business, technology, industry, teaching, government, and finance.</p>
<p>Students majoring in Mathematics may choose to major with a teaching concentration. The teaching concentration is designed to increase the number and quality of math teachers.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Students should contact a mathematics undergraduate advisor. Contact information is available on the contact tab or<a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/advising"> </a><a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/advising">here.</a></p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>In addition to completing the requirements for the major in mathematics, students in the honors program must:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Earn a grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.5 in upper division and graduate courses in the major and <em>at</em> <em>least</em> 3.3 in all courses taken at the University.</li>
	<li>Complete either <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MATH%20196" title="MATH 196" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 196');">MATH 196</a></span>, in which they will write a senior honors thesis, or pass two graduate mathematics courses with a grade of at least A-.</li>

	<li>Receive the recommendation of the head major advisor.</li>
</ol>

<p>Students interested in the honors program should consult with an advisor early in their program, preferably by their junior year.</p>

<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average of 2.0 is required for the lower division minor requirements as well as for the five upper division courses used for the minor.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which the student plans to graduate. </li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>Mathematics is the language of science. In Galileo’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Philosophy is written in this grand book, the universe, which stands continually open to our gaze. But the book cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and read the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures, without which it is impossible to understand a single word of it. Without those, one is wandering in a dark labyrinth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mathematics majors learn the internal workings of this language, its central concepts and their interconnections. These involve structures going far beyond the geometric figures to which Galileo refers. Majors also learn to use mathematical concepts to formulate, analyze, and solve real-world problems. Their training in rigorous thought and creative problem-solving is valuable not just in science, but in all walks of life.</p>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>By the time of graduation, majors should have acquired the following knowledge and skills:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Analytical skills
	<ul>
		<li>An understanding of the basic rules of logic.</li>
		<li>The ability to distinguish a coherent argument from a fallacious one, both in mathematical reasoning and in everyday life.</li>
		<li>An understanding of the role of axioms or assumptions.</li>
		<li>The ability to abstract general principles from examples.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Problem-solving and modeling skills (important for all, but especially for majors in Applied Mathematics)
	<ul>
		<li>The ability to recognize which real-world problems are subject to mathematical reasoning.</li>
		<li>The ability to make vague ideas precise by representing them in mathematical notation, when appropriate.</li>
		<li>Techniques for solving problems expressed in mathematical notation.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Communication skills
	<ul>
		<li>The ability to formulate a mathematical statement precisely.</li>
		<li>The ability to write a coherent proof.</li>
		<li>The ability to present a mathematical argument verbally.</li>
		<li>Majors in Mathematics with a Teaching Concentration should acquire familiarity with techniques for explaining K-12 mathematics in an accessible and mathematically correct manner.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Reading and research skills
	<ul>
		<li>Sufficient experience in mathematical language and foundational material to be well-prepared to extend one’s mathematical knowledge further through independent reading.</li>
		<li>Exposure to and successful experience in solving mathematical problems presenting substantial intellectual challenge.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

Students are strongly encouraged to see an undergraduate advisor at least twice a year.</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-eff33bc5-7fff-a5a2-d743-1f80b63330e4">Faculty advisors are also available to students.</span> Faculty advisors approve major electives which are not already pre-approved and listed on our website and can also approve courses from study abroad or other 4 year institutions towards a student’s upper-division major requirements. Appropriate questions for the faculty adviser include selection of electives and preparation for graduate level courses in a specific mathematical area to be used for honors in the major. Be sure and let him/her know if you are considering graduate work in or related to mathematics, and if you need to solicit help in how best to prepare.</p>
<p>We also encourage students to take advantage of the expertise of the <span id="docs-internal-guid-23bb7bf4-7fff-836f-5f4a-c3d6eb7b34f8">Math Department’s </span>Peer Advisors. They can provide a student perspective on courses, instructors, effective study habits, and enrichment opportunities.

Berkeley Connect is a mentoring program, offered through various academic departments, that helps students build intellectual community. Over the course of a semester, enrolled students participate in regular small-group discussions facilitated by a graduate student mentor (following a faculty-directed curriculum), meet with their graduate student mentor for one-on-one academic advising, attend lectures and panel discussions featuring department</span><span class="deschide"> faculty and alumni, and go on field trips to campus resources. Students are not required to be declared majors in order to participate.</span><br/>
