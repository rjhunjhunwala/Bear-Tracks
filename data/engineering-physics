				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The engineering physics major offered through the Engineering Science Program interweaves classical and modern physics, chemistry, and mathematics with their engineering applications. Chief among the attractions of the major is its flexibility in that students have the ability to take diverse engineering, math, and science classes based on individual research goals. The solid base in physics and mathematics is augmented with a selection of engineering course options that prepare students to tackle complex problems faced by society.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates in the College of Engineering must apply to one specific major/degree program. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is very competitive as there few open spaces in engineering for students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in engineering physics.</p>
