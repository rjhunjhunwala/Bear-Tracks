				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The major in Classical Languages provides training in both ancient Greek and Latin, enabling students to encounter texts such as Homer's <em>Odyssey </em>and Virgil's <em>Aeneid </em>in their original form. Students can begin their study of the languages in our department or build on knowledge acquired elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>The easiest way to declare a major is to meet with an undergraduate advisor, who will have all the necessary forms. Please also see the Letters &amp; Science Advising site for a guide to <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/degree-requirements/declaring-major" target="_blank">declaring a major</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-ce556fc5-39a9-aa53-621f-a00b7d7a5338">Students who are declared majors in Classical Languages and who have a GPA (both general and departmental) of at least 3.6 are eligible for honors in Classical Languages. The honors program consists of a two-semester course sequence, either <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195A" title="GREEK H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195A');">GREEK H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195B" title="GREEK H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195B');">GREEK H195B</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATIN%20H195A" title="LATIN H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATIN H195A');">LATIN H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATIN%20H195B" title="LATIN H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATIN H195B');">LATIN H195B</a></span>, that is designed to support the writing of a thesis. This thesis, which will be evaluated by an honors committee of three members, may either build on work in a previous upper division course used in fulfillment of the Classical Languages major or may be a newly conceived project. It is due the Monday of the 13th week of the semester in which the relevant H195B is taken.</span>
</p>

<p>Further details can be found online at <a href="http://www.classics.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/honors" target="_blank">Classics Undergraduate Honors</a>. Please consult with a Classics undergraduate advisor to begin planning to participate in Honors.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Classical Languages. Students who wish to pursue a classical language at the minor level should consider the Greek or Latin minors. See below.</p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The learning goals should be understood in the context of the mission statement of the Department of Classics. The first two components of that statement are especially relevant to undergraduate teaching and are repeated here:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To give students across the University access to the literature, history, archaeology, mythology and philosophy of the ancient Greek and Roman world through an array of undergraduate courses on classical culture in translation. These courses introduce students to texts, artifacts, and ideas that are worth studying both in their own right and as abidingly influential elements in the imagination and history of later cultures. Such study deepens students' understanding of present-day issues by inculcating a sense of historical perspective that takes account of both the differences and the continuities between contemporary and ancient cultures.</li>
	<li>
	<p>To enable undergraduates to immerse themselves in the language and culture of ancient Greece and Rome through its majors in Greek, Latin, and Classical Civilizations. These majors equip students with knowledge and analytical skills that can be applied in many areas (e.g., law, politics, business, biosciences, computer science and media) as well as providing essential preparation for graduate study in Classics, Comparative Literature, Philosophy, and other fields.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-1723b9aa-dd8e-757a-6dfd-ec48024eec01">Learning Goals for the Major</span></h3>
<ol>
	<li>Acquire a basic grounding in the vocabulary, morphology, and syntax of classical Greek and Latin.</li>
	<li>Practice the skills needed to use dictionaries, grammars, and other resources to read intermediate texts accurately and to deal comfortably with at least some advanced texts in the original language(s).</li>
	<li>Learn to identify and understand key events, institutions, personalities, places, and concepts of ancient Greek and Roman culture.</li>
	<li>Gain a critical awareness of continuities and differences between and within cultures and of ideologies of gender, group identity, social status, and political organization.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to interpret texts and material culture and to understand the implications of interpretive methods.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal English prose.</li>

This course will focus on ideas about magic in the Greek and Roman worlds from about 750 BCE through 400 CE. Topics will include witches, holy men, love spells, necromancy, spirits, and mystery religions.

The ancient Mediterranean world was a world full of gods: from the poems of Homer to the small towns of the Roman empire, we can find people constantly interacting with and thinking about the gods. Myth, ritual, oracles, mystery cults, magic, philosophy: these were all ways that Greeks and Romans engaged with the divine. War, peace, health, sickness, hope, fear: these were some of the reasons for these engagements. This course explores the polytheism</span><span class="deschide"> of ancient Greece and Rome (c.800 BCE to c.200 CE), with close attention to both the ancient literary evidence and the archaeological material from the period. We will seek to understand both the long-term continuities and the important changes in religious life during Mediterranean antiquity.</span><br/>

This course examines the origins of Rome, the quintessential city in the Western experience. It considers both the literary and archaeological evidence for the earliest periods of the city’s occupation, and the challenges involved in using and combining these two quite different forms of evidence. Particular attention will be given to recent archaeological discoveries and the ways in which these are transforming our understanding of early Rome. The course also examines</span><span class="deschide"> the ways in which people in later periods – both in antiquity and in more recent times - have drawn on their knowledge of early Rome for a variety of different purposes, ranging from politics, to scholarship, to the arts.

Classical literature is full of mythological plots involving gods and monsters, heroes and kings. Less prominent are the kind of plots we are used to from modern literature, especially novels: plots that revolve around fictional characters invented to look like people in the street.

part of ancient literature.

Religion and literature are two conceptual systems through which people and societies organize disparate experiences into meaningful wholes. In the ancient pagan societies of Greece and Rome, where a shared experience of both religion and literature was a defining element of the community, these two systems were particularly interdependent. In this course we will read a variety of texts (e.g. epic, philosophy, tragedy) and examine the complex ways that literary</span><span class="deschide"> concepts such as plot, character, closure and genre interact with religious concepts such as causation, moral justice, divine power, cosmology.

This course aims to explore the development of classical Greek rhetoric from the fifth century through the end of the fourth century BCE. In light of Plato’s and Aristotle’s analyses of the subject, we tend to view rhetoric as an art (technê) consisting of a set of methodically organized principles or norms for the production of persuasive speech. The use of rhetorical techniques, however, was widespread in the Greek speaking world well before Plato and Aristotle</span><span class="deschide"> began to reflect on its norms.

We will be seeking to elicit the points of contact between the two commemorative traditions, visual and literary</span><span class="deschide">, and to understand the sometimes similar functions they serve. But we will also be attempting to bring out the differences in the way that biographical texts and portrait images operate, and the consequences that this has for the way we, as historians, must approach them.</span><br/>

What time is it? How old is the earth? Where are we located in history? For us these questions may have simple answers: we can look at a watch or a calendar or a timeline. But ancient people thought very differently about these questions. The aim of this class is to see how. We will look at a variety of ancient evidence, including literature (in translation) and archaeology, to discover how Greeks and Romans thought about the deep past (mythic time), how they understood</span><span class="deschide"> the direction and order of history, and how they organized and calculated time in their communities. We will also consider how ancient Jews and Christians came to reject classical conceptions of time and how this rejection still informs modern ideas about time and history.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The major in Classical Languages provides training in both ancient Greek and Latin, enabling students to encounter texts such as Homer's <em>Odyssey </em>and Virgil's <em>Aeneid </em>in their original form. Students can begin their study of the languages in our department or build on knowledge acquired elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>The easiest way to declare a major is to meet with an undergraduate advisor, who will have all the necessary forms. Please also see the Letters &amp; Science Advising site for a guide to <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/degree-requirements/declaring-major" target="_blank">declaring a major</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-ce556fc5-39a9-aa53-621f-a00b7d7a5338">Students who are declared majors in Classical Languages and who have a GPA (both general and departmental) of at least 3.6 are eligible for honors in Classical Languages. The honors program consists of a two-semester course sequence, either <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195A" title="GREEK H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195A');">GREEK H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195B" title="GREEK H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195B');">GREEK H195B</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATIN%20H195A" title="LATIN H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATIN H195A');">LATIN H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATIN%20H195B" title="LATIN H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATIN H195B');">LATIN H195B</a></span>, that is designed to support the writing of a thesis. This thesis, which will be evaluated by an honors committee of three members, may either build on work in a previous upper division course used in fulfillment of the Classical Languages major or may be a newly conceived project. It is due the Monday of the 13th week of the semester in which the relevant H195B is taken.</span>
</p>

<p>Further details can be found online at <a href="http://www.classics.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/honors" target="_blank">Classics Undergraduate Honors</a>. Please consult with a Classics undergraduate advisor to begin planning to participate in Honors.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Classical Languages. Students who wish to pursue a classical language at the minor level should consider the Greek or Latin minors. See below.</p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The learning goals should be understood in the context of the mission statement of the Department of Classics. The first two components of that statement are especially relevant to undergraduate teaching and are repeated here:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To give students across the University access to the literature, history, archaeology, mythology and philosophy of the ancient Greek and Roman world through an array of undergraduate courses on classical culture in translation. These courses introduce students to texts, artifacts, and ideas that are worth studying both in their own right and as abidingly influential elements in the imagination and history of later cultures. Such study deepens students' understanding of present-day issues by inculcating a sense of historical perspective that takes account of both the differences and the continuities between contemporary and ancient cultures.</li>
	<li>
	<p>To enable undergraduates to immerse themselves in the language and culture of ancient Greece and Rome through its majors in Greek, Latin, and Classical Civilizations. These majors equip students with knowledge and analytical skills that can be applied in many areas (e.g., law, politics, business, biosciences, computer science and media) as well as providing essential preparation for graduate study in Classics, Comparative Literature, Philosophy, and other fields.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-1723b9aa-dd8e-757a-6dfd-ec48024eec01">Learning Goals for the Major</span></h3>
<ol>
	<li>Acquire a basic grounding in the vocabulary, morphology, and syntax of classical Greek and Latin.</li>
	<li>Practice the skills needed to use dictionaries, grammars, and other resources to read intermediate texts accurately and to deal comfortably with at least some advanced texts in the original language(s).</li>
	<li>Learn to identify and understand key events, institutions, personalities, places, and concepts of ancient Greek and Roman culture.</li>
	<li>Gain a critical awareness of continuities and differences between and within cultures and of ideologies of gender, group identity, social status, and political organization.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to interpret texts and material culture and to understand the implications of interpretive methods.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal English prose.</li>

This course will focus on ideas about magic in the Greek and Roman worlds from about 750 BCE through 400 CE. Topics will include witches, holy men, love spells, necromancy, spirits, and mystery religions. We will examine how magic was represented in high literature (by authors like Homer, Ovid, Apuleius, and Lucian). as well as the more practical evidence of curse tablets and the Greek Magical Papyri. Consideration will be given</span><span class="deschide"> to analyzing the relationship between magic, religion, and philosophy. Our goal will be to study the common threads that connect different Greek and Roman magical practices, as well as to understand them in their cultural contexts.</span><br/>

The ancient Mediterranean world was a world full of gods: from the poems of Homer to the small towns of the Roman empire, we can find people constantly interacting with and thinking about the gods. Myth, ritual, oracles, mystery cults, magic, philosophy: these were all ways that Greeks and Romans engaged with the divine. War, peace, health, sickness, hope, fear: these were some of the reasons for these engagements. This course explores the polytheism</span><span class="deschide"> of ancient Greece and Rome (c.800 BCE to c.200 CE), with close attention to both the ancient literary evidence and the archaeological material from the period. We will seek to understand both the long-term continuities and the important changes in religious life during Mediterranean antiquity.</span><br/>

Less prominent are the kind of plots we are used to from modern literature, especially novels: plots that revolve around fictional characters invented to look like people in the street.

Religion and literature are two conceptual systems through which people and societies organize disparate experiences into meaningful wholes. In the ancient pagan societies of Greece and Rome, where a shared experience of both religion and literature was a defining element of the community, these two systems were particularly interdependent. In this course we will read a variety of texts (e.g. epic, philosophy, tragedy) and examine the complex ways that literary</span><span class="deschide"> concepts such as plot, character, closure and genre interact with religious concepts such as causation, moral justice, divine power, cosmology.

This course aims to explore the development of classical Greek rhetoric from the fifth century through the end of the fourth century BCE. In light of Plato’s and Aristotle’s analyses of the subject, we tend to view rhetoric as an art (technê) consisting of a set of methodically organized principles or norms for the production of persuasive speech. The use of rhetorical techniques, however, was widespread in the Greek speaking world well before Plato and Aristotle</span><span class="deschide"> began to reflect on its norms.

This course will focus on ideas about magic in the Greek and Roman worlds from about 750 BCE through 400 CE. Topics will include witches, holy men, love spells, necromancy, spirits, and mystery religions.We will examine how magic was represented in high literature (by authors like Homer, Ovid, Apuleius and Lucian) as well as the more practical evidence of curse tablets and the Greek Magical Papyri. Consideration will be given to analyzing the relationship between</span><span class="deschide"> magic, religion, and philosophy. Our goal will be to study the common threads that connect different Greek and Roman magical practices, as well as to understand them in their cultural contexts.

Slavery was one of the central institutions of life in classical Greece and Rome and had a profound affect on the ways these societies represented themselves and their world. In this course we will first spend some time learning about the historical condition of slavery in these two societies, then read a variety of works that show some of the ways that slaves and slavery operated in the intellectual and imaginative life of ancient authors. The three genres we will</span><span class="deschide"> focus on are philosophy, drama (both tragedy and comedy) and the novel. There will be a variety of writing assignments of differing lengths and a final exam.</span><br/>

Important individuals in Greek and Roman society were commemorated both in honorific portraits and in biographies written to record for posterity their lives and achievements. In this class we will be reading a selection of Greek and Latin biographical texts (in translation) and comparing them with statuary monuments that represent the same individuals. We will be seeking to elicit the points of contact between the two commemorative traditions, visual and literary</span><span class="deschide">, and to understand the sometimes similar functions they serve. But we will also be attempting to bring out the differences in the way that biographical texts and portrait images operate, and the consequences that this has for the way we, as historians, must approach them.</span><br/>

What time is it? How old is the earth? Where are we located in history? For us these questions may have simple answers: we can look at a watch or a calendar or a timeline. But ancient people thought very differently about these questions. The aim of this class is to see how. We will look at a variety of ancient evidence, including literature (in translation) and archaeology, to discover how Greeks and Romans thought about the deep past (mythic time), how they understood</span><span class="deschide"> the direction and order of history, and how they organized and calculated time in their communities. We will also consider how ancient Jews and Christians came to reject classical conceptions of time and how this rejection still informs modern ideas about time and history.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The major in Classical Languages provides training in both ancient Greek and Latin, enabling students to encounter texts such as Homer's <em>Odyssey </em>and Virgil's <em>Aeneid </em>in their original form. Students can begin their study of the languages in our department or build on knowledge acquired elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>The easiest way to declare a major is to meet with an undergraduate advisor, who will have all the necessary forms. Please also see the Letters &amp; Science Advising site for a guide to <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/degree-requirements/declaring-major" target="_blank">declaring a major</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-ce556fc5-39a9-aa53-621f-a00b7d7a5338">Students who are declared majors in Classical Languages and who have a GPA (both general and departmental) of at least 3.6 are eligible for honors in Classical Languages. The honors program consists of a two-semester course sequence, either <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195A" title="GREEK H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195A');">GREEK H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195B" title="GREEK H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195B');">GREEK H195B</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATIN%20H195A" title="LATIN H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATIN H195A');">LATIN H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATIN%20H195B" title="LATIN H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATIN H195B');">LATIN H195B</a></span>, that is designed to support the writing of a thesis. This thesis, which will be evaluated by an honors committee of three members, may either build on work in a previous upper division course used in fulfillment of the Classical Languages major or may be a newly conceived project. It is due the Monday of the 13th week of the semester in which the relevant H195B is taken.</span>
</p>

<p>Further details can be found online at <a href="http://www.classics.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/honors" target="_blank">Classics Undergraduate Honors</a>. Please consult with a Classics undergraduate advisor to begin planning to participate in Honors.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Classical Languages. Students who wish to pursue a classical language at the minor level should consider the Greek or Latin minors. See below.</p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The learning goals should be understood in the context of the mission statement of the Department of Classics. The first two components of that statement are especially relevant to undergraduate teaching and are repeated here:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To give students across the University access to the literature, history, archaeology, mythology and philosophy of the ancient Greek and Roman world through an array of undergraduate courses on classical culture in translation. These courses introduce students to texts, artifacts, and ideas that are worth studying both in their own right and as abidingly influential elements in the imagination and history of later cultures. Such study deepens students' understanding of present-day issues by inculcating a sense of historical perspective that takes account of both the differences and the continuities between contemporary and ancient cultures.</li>
	<li>
	<p>To enable undergraduates to immerse themselves in the language and culture of ancient Greece and Rome through its majors in Greek, Latin, and Classical Civilizations. These majors equip students with knowledge and analytical skills that can be applied in many areas (e.g., law, politics, business, biosciences, computer science and media) as well as providing essential preparation for graduate study in Classics, Comparative Literature, Philosophy, and other fields.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-1723b9aa-dd8e-757a-6dfd-ec48024eec01">Learning Goals for the Major</span></h3>
<ol>
	<li>Acquire a basic grounding in the vocabulary, morphology, and syntax of classical Greek and Latin.</li>
	<li>Practice the skills needed to use dictionaries, grammars, and other resources to read intermediate texts accurately and to deal comfortably with at least some advanced texts in the original language(s).</li>
	<li>Learn to identify and understand key events, institutions, personalities, places, and concepts of ancient Greek and Roman culture.</li>
	<li>Gain a critical awareness of continuities and differences between and within cultures and of ideologies of gender, group identity, social status, and political organization.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to interpret texts and material culture and to understand the implications of interpretive methods.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal English prose.</li>

This course will focus on ideas about magic in the Greek and Roman worlds from about 750 BCE through 400 CE. Topics will include witches, holy men, love spells, necromancy, spirits, and mystery religions. We will examine how magic was represented in high literature (by authors like Homer, Ovid, Apuleius, and Lucian). as well as the more practical evidence of curse tablets and the Greek Magical Papyri. Consideration will be given</span><span class="deschide"> to analyzing the relationship between magic, religion, and philosophy. Our goal will be to study the common threads that connect different Greek and Roman magical practices, as well as to understand them in their cultural contexts.</span><br/>

The ancient Mediterranean world was a world full of gods: from the poems of Homer to the small towns of the Roman empire, we can find people constantly interacting with and thinking about the gods. Myth, ritual, oracles, mystery cults, magic, philosophy: these were all ways that Greeks and Romans engaged with the divine. War, peace, health, sickness, hope, fear: these were some of the reasons for these engagements. This course explores the polytheism</span><span class="deschide"> of ancient Greece and Rome (c.800 BCE to c.200 CE), with close attention to both the ancient literary evidence and the archaeological material from the period. We will seek to understand both the long-term continuities and the important changes in religious life during Mediterranean antiquity.</span><br/>

Religion and literature are two conceptual systems through which people and societies organize disparate experiences into meaningful wholes. In the ancient pagan societies of Greece and Rome, where a shared experience of both religion and literature was a defining element of the community, these two systems were particularly interdependent. In this course we will read a variety of texts (e.g. epic, philosophy, tragedy) and examine the complex ways that literary</span><span class="deschide"> concepts such as plot, character, closure and genre interact with religious concepts such as causation, moral justice, divine power, cosmology.

This course aims to explore the development of classical Greek rhetoric from the fifth century through the end of the fourth century BCE. In light of Plato’s and Aristotle’s analyses of the subject, we tend to view rhetoric as an art (technê) consisting of a set of methodically organized principles or norms for the production of persuasive speech. The use of rhetorical techniques, however, was widespread in the Greek speaking world well before Plato and Aristotle</span><span class="deschide"> began to reflect on its norms.

Egypt: No other region of the Graeco-Roman world provides us with as much information about the daily lives of its inhabitants, and no body of ancient evidence is more inclusive in its coverage. In this course, we will read selections from this corpus of evidence closely, focusing on documentary papyri, but also looking at literature, inscriptions, and other cultural objects (as well as some later comparative material). We will discuss what this material contributes</span><span class="deschide"> to our understanding of Graeco-Roman Egypt’s society and economy (law and status, gender, labor systems, education, religious practice, etc.), the limitations of the evidence, and its applicability to other regions of the ancient Mediterranean.

In this course, we will look at ancient Greek ideas and practices concerning the nature, sources, psychological effects, and social functions of music (including singing, instrumental music, and dance), during the Archaic and Classical periods (ca. 800-350 BCE). Taking an ethnomusicological approach, we will examine Greek musical culture as a whole, focusing especially on differences of gender, ethnicity, regionalism, class/status (e.g., free vs. slave), and even</span><span class="deschide"> species – since the Greeks recognized that some animals are very musical, as of course are several of the gods and goddesses – to see what different kinds of music were played by the various performers, and at what kinds of occasions.

Slavery was one of the central institutions of life in classical Greece and Rome and had a profound affect on the ways these societies represented themselves and their world. In this course we will first spend some time learning about the historical condition of slavery in these two societies, then read a variety of works that show some of the ways that slaves and slavery operated in the intellectual and imaginative life of ancient authors. The three genres we will</span><span class="deschide"> focus on are philosophy, drama (both tragedy and comedy) and the novel.

Important individuals in Greek and Roman society were commemorated both in honorific portraits and in biographies written to record for posterity their lives and achievements. In this class we will be reading a selection of Greek and Latin biographical texts (in translation) and comparing them with statuary monuments that represent the same individuals. We will be seeking to elicit the points of contact between the two commemorative traditions, visual and literary</span><span class="deschide">, and to understand the sometimes similar functions they serve.

What time is it? How old is the earth? Where are we located in history? For us these questions may have simple answers: we can look at a watch or a calendar or a timeline. But ancient people thought very differently about these questions. The aim of this class is to see how. We will look at a variety of ancient evidence, including literature (in translation) and archaeology, to discover how Greeks and Romans thought about the deep past (mythic time), how they understood</span><span class="deschide"> the direction and order of history, and how they organized and calculated time in their communities. We will also consider how ancient Jews and Christians came to reject classical conceptions of time and how this rejection still informs modern ideas about time and history.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The major in Classical Languages provides training in both ancient Greek and Latin, enabling students to encounter texts such as Homer's <em>Odyssey </em>and Virgil's <em>Aeneid </em>in their original form. Students can begin their study of the languages in our department or build on knowledge acquired elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>The easiest way to declare a major is to meet with an undergraduate advisor, who will have all the necessary forms. Please also see the Letters &amp; Science Advising site for a guide to <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/degree-requirements/declaring-major" target="_blank">declaring a major</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-ce556fc5-39a9-aa53-621f-a00b7d7a5338">Students who are declared majors in Classical Languages and who have a GPA (both general and departmental) of at least 3.6 are eligible for honors in Classical Languages. The honors program consists of a two-semester course sequence, either <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195A" title="GREEK H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195A');">GREEK H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195B" title="GREEK H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195B');">GREEK H195B</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATIN%20H195A" title="LATIN H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATIN H195A');">LATIN H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATIN%20H195B" title="LATIN H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATIN H195B');">LATIN H195B</a></span>, that is designed to support the writing of a thesis. This thesis, which will be evaluated by an honors committee of three members, may either build on work in a previous upper division course used in fulfillment of the Classical Languages major or may be a newly conceived project. It is due the Monday of the 13th week of the semester in which the relevant H195B is taken.</span>
</p>

<p>Further details can be found online at <a href="http://www.classics.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/honors" target="_blank">Classics Undergraduate Honors</a>. Please consult with a Classics undergraduate advisor to begin planning to participate in Honors.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Classical Languages. Students who wish to pursue a classical language at the minor level should consider the Greek or Latin minors. See below.</p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The learning goals should be understood in the context of the mission statement of the Department of Classics. The first two components of that statement are especially relevant to undergraduate teaching and are repeated here:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To give students across the University access to the literature, history, archaeology, mythology and philosophy of the ancient Greek and Roman world through an array of undergraduate courses on classical culture in translation. These courses introduce students to texts, artifacts, and ideas that are worth studying both in their own right and as abidingly influential elements in the imagination and history of later cultures. Such study deepens students' understanding of present-day issues by inculcating a sense of historical perspective that takes account of both the differences and the continuities between contemporary and ancient cultures.</li>
	<li>
	<p>To enable undergraduates to immerse themselves in the language and culture of ancient Greece and Rome through its majors in Greek, Latin, and Classical Civilizations. These majors equip students with knowledge and analytical skills that can be applied in many areas (e.g., law, politics, business, biosciences, computer science and media) as well as providing essential preparation for graduate study in Classics, Comparative Literature, Philosophy, and other fields.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-1723b9aa-dd8e-757a-6dfd-ec48024eec01">Learning Goals for the Major</span></h3>
<ol>
	<li>Acquire a basic grounding in the vocabulary, morphology, and syntax of classical Greek and Latin.</li>
	<li>Practice the skills needed to use dictionaries, grammars, and other resources to read intermediate texts accurately and to deal comfortably with at least some advanced texts in the original language(s).</li>
	<li>Learn to identify and understand key events, institutions, personalities, places, and concepts of ancient Greek and Roman culture.</li>
	<li>Gain a critical awareness of continuities and differences between and within cultures and of ideologies of gender, group identity, social status, and political organization.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to interpret texts and material culture and to understand the implications of interpretive methods.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal English prose.</li>

The ancient Mediterranean world was a world full of gods: from the poems of Homer to the small towns of the Roman empire, we can find people constantly interacting with and thinking about the gods. Myth, ritual, oracles, mystery cults, magic, philosophy: these were all ways that Greeks and Romans engaged with the divine. War, peace, health, sickness, hope, fear: these were some of the reasons for these engagements. This course explores the polytheism</span><span class="deschide"> of ancient Greece and Rome (c.800 BCE to c.200 CE), with close attention to both the ancient literary evidence and the archaeological material from the period. We will seek to understand both the long-term continuities and the important changes in religious life during Mediterranean antiquity.</span><br/>

Particular attention will be given to recent archaeological discoveries and the ways in which these are transforming our understanding of early Rome. The course also examines</span><span class="deschide"> the ways in which people in later periods – both in antiquity and in more recent times - have drawn on their knowledge of early Rome for a variety of different purposes, ranging from politics, to scholarship, to the arts. No knowledge of Greek or Latin required.</span><br/>

Classical literature is full of mythological plots involving gods and monsters, heroes and kings. Less prominent are the kind of plots we are used to from modern literature, especially novels: plots that revolve around fictional characters invented to look like people in the street. Although these latter forms of literature are distanced from the prestigious genres of epic and tragedy, they still constitute an important<br/>
part of ancient literature. In this class</span><span class="deschide"> we will not only read a variety of texts that aim to depict &quot;everyday life&quot; (including novels, satire, letters, comedy and more), but we will also consider the underlying principles of such literature.

Religion and literature are two conceptual systems through which people and societies organize disparate experiences into meaningful wholes. In the ancient pagan societies of Greece and Rome, where a shared experience of both religion and literature was a defining element of the community, these two systems were particularly interdependent. In this course we will read a variety of texts (e.g. epic, philosophy, tragedy) and examine the complex ways that literary</span><span class="deschide"> concepts such as plot, character, closure and genre interact with religious concepts such as causation, moral justice, divine power, cosmology.

This course aims to explore the development of classical Greek rhetoric from the fifth century through the end of the fourth century BCE. In light of Plato’s and Aristotle’s analyses of the subject, we tend to view rhetoric as an art (technê) consisting of a set of methodically organized principles or norms for the production of persuasive speech. The use of rhetorical techniques, however, was widespread in the Greek speaking world well before Plato and Aristotle</span><span class="deschide"> began to reflect on its norms.

Slavery was one of the central institutions of life in classical Greece and Rome and had a profound affect on the ways these societies represented themselves and their world.

In this class we will be reading a selection of Greek and Latin biographical texts (in translation) and comparing them with statuary monuments that represent the same individuals.

What time is it? How old is the earth? Where are we located in history? For us these questions may have simple answers: we can look at a watch or a calendar or a timeline. But ancient people thought very differently about these questions. The aim of this class is to see how. We will look at a variety of ancient evidence, including literature (in translation) and archaeology, to discover how Greeks and Romans thought about the deep past (mythic time), how they understood</span><span class="deschide"> the direction and order of history, and how they organized and calculated time in their communities. We will also consider how ancient Jews and Christians came to reject classical conceptions of time and how this rejection still informs modern ideas about time and history.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The major in Classical Languages provides training in both ancient Greek and Latin, enabling students to encounter texts such as Homer's <em>Odyssey </em>and Virgil's <em>Aeneid </em>in their original form. Students can begin their study of the languages in our department or build on knowledge acquired elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>The easiest way to declare a major is to meet with an undergraduate advisor, who will have all the necessary forms. Please also see the Letters &amp; Science Advising site for a guide to <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/degree-requirements/declaring-major" target="_blank">declaring a major</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-ce556fc5-39a9-aa53-621f-a00b7d7a5338">Students who are declared majors in Classical Languages and who have a GPA (both general and departmental) of at least 3.6 are eligible for honors in Classical Languages. The honors program consists of a two-semester course sequence, either <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195A" title="GREEK H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195A');">GREEK H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195B" title="GREEK H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195B');">GREEK H195B</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATIN%20H195A" title="LATIN H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATIN H195A');">LATIN H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATIN%20H195B" title="LATIN H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATIN H195B');">LATIN H195B</a></span>, that is designed to support the writing of a thesis. This thesis, which will be evaluated by an honors committee of three members, may either build on work in a previous upper division course used in fulfillment of the Classical Languages major or may be a newly conceived project. It is due the Monday of the 13th week of the semester in which the relevant H195B is taken.</span>
</p>

<p>Further details can be found online at <a href="http://www.classics.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/honors" target="_blank">Classics Undergraduate Honors</a>. Please consult with a Classics undergraduate advisor to begin planning to participate in Honors.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Classical Languages. Students who wish to pursue a classical language at the minor level should consider the Greek or Latin minors. See below.</p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The learning goals should be understood in the context of the mission statement of the Department of Classics. The first two components of that statement are especially relevant to undergraduate teaching and are repeated here:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To give students across the University access to the literature, history, archaeology, mythology and philosophy of the ancient Greek and Roman world through an array of undergraduate courses on classical culture in translation. These courses introduce students to texts, artifacts, and ideas that are worth studying both in their own right and as abidingly influential elements in the imagination and history of later cultures. Such study deepens students' understanding of present-day issues by inculcating a sense of historical perspective that takes account of both the differences and the continuities between contemporary and ancient cultures.</li>
	<li>
	<p>To enable undergraduates to immerse themselves in the language and culture of ancient Greece and Rome through its majors in Greek, Latin, and Classical Civilizations. These majors equip students with knowledge and analytical skills that can be applied in many areas (e.g., law, politics, business, biosciences, computer science and media) as well as providing essential preparation for graduate study in Classics, Comparative Literature, Philosophy, and other fields.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-1723b9aa-dd8e-757a-6dfd-ec48024eec01">Learning Goals for the Major</span></h3>
<ol>
	<li>Acquire a basic grounding in the vocabulary, morphology, and syntax of classical Greek and Latin.</li>
	<li>Practice the skills needed to use dictionaries, grammars, and other resources to read intermediate texts accurately and to deal comfortably with at least some advanced texts in the original language(s).</li>
	<li>Learn to identify and understand key events, institutions, personalities, places, and concepts of ancient Greek and Roman culture.</li>
	<li>Gain a critical awareness of continuities and differences between and within cultures and of ideologies of gender, group identity, social status, and political organization.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to interpret texts and material culture and to understand the implications of interpretive methods.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal English prose.</li>

This course will focus on ideas about magic in the Greek and Roman worlds from about 750 BCE through 400 CE. Topics will include witches, holy men, love spells, necromancy, spirits, and mystery religions. We will examine how magic was represented in high literature (by authors like Homer, Ovid, Apuleius, and Lucian). as well as the more practical evidence of curse tablets and the Greek Magical Papyri. Consideration will be given</span><span class="deschide"> to analyzing the relationship between magic, religion, and philosophy. Our goal will be to study the common threads that connect different Greek and Roman magical practices, as well as to understand them in their cultural contexts.</span><br/>

The ancient Mediterranean world was a world full of gods: from the poems of Homer to the small towns of the Roman empire, we can find people constantly interacting with and thinking about the gods. Myth, ritual, oracles, mystery cults, magic, philosophy: these were all ways that Greeks and Romans engaged with the divine. War, peace, health, sickness, hope, fear: these were some of the reasons for these engagements. This course explores the polytheism</span><span class="deschide"> of ancient Greece and Rome (c.800 BCE to c.200 CE), with close attention to both the ancient literary evidence and the archaeological material from the period. We will seek to understand both the long-term continuities and the important changes in religious life during Mediterranean antiquity.</span><br/>

Classical literature is full of mythological plots involving gods and monsters, heroes and kings. Less prominent are the kind of plots we are used to from modern literature, especially novels: plots that revolve around fictional characters invented to look like people in the street.

Religion and literature are two conceptual systems through which people and societies organize disparate experiences into meaningful wholes. In the ancient pagan societies of Greece and Rome, where a shared experience of both religion and literature was a defining element of the community, these two systems were particularly interdependent. In this course we will read a variety of texts (e.g. epic, philosophy, tragedy) and examine the complex ways that literary</span><span class="deschide"> concepts such as plot, character, closure and genre interact with religious concepts such as causation, moral justice, divine power, cosmology.

This course aims to explore the development of classical Greek rhetoric from the fifth century through the end of the fourth century BCE. In light of Plato’s and Aristotle’s analyses of the subject, we tend to view rhetoric as an art (technê) consisting of a set of methodically organized principles or norms for the production of persuasive speech. The use of rhetorical techniques, however, was widespread in the Greek speaking world well before Plato and Aristotle</span><span class="deschide"> began to reflect on its norms.

This course will focus on ideas about magic in the Greek and Roman worlds from about 750 BCE through 400 CE. Topics will include witches, holy men, love spells, necromancy, spirits, and mystery religions.We will examine how magic was represented in high literature (by authors like Homer, Ovid, Apuleius and Lucian) as well as the more practical evidence of curse tablets and the Greek Magical Papyri. Consideration will be given to analyzing the relationship between</span><span class="deschide"> magic, religion, and philosophy. Our goal will be to study the common threads that connect different Greek and Roman magical practices, as well as to understand them in their cultural contexts. No knowledge of Greek or Latin required.</span><br/>

Slavery was one of the central institutions of life in classical Greece and Rome and had a profound affect on the ways these societies represented themselves and their world. In this course we will first spend some time learning about the historical condition of slavery in these two societies, then read a variety of works that show some of the ways that slaves and slavery operated in the intellectual and imaginative life of ancient authors. The three genres we will</span><span class="deschide"> focus on are philosophy, drama (both tragedy and comedy) and the novel. There will be a variety of writing assignments of differing lengths and a final exam.</span><br/>

Important individuals in Greek and Roman society were commemorated both in honorific portraits and in biographies written to record for posterity their lives and achievements. In this class we will be reading a selection of Greek and Latin biographical texts (in translation) and comparing them with statuary monuments that represent the same individuals. We will be seeking to elicit the points of contact between the two commemorative traditions, visual and literary</span><span class="deschide">, and to understand the sometimes similar functions they serve. But we will also be attempting to bring out the differences in the way that biographical texts and portrait images operate, and the consequences that this has for the way we, as historians, must approach them.</span><br/>

What time is it? How old is the earth? Where are we located in history? For us these questions may have simple answers: we can look at a watch or a calendar or a timeline. But ancient people thought very differently about these questions. The aim of this class is to see how. We will look at a variety of ancient evidence, including literature (in translation) and archaeology, to discover how Greeks and Romans thought about the deep past (mythic time), how they understood</span><span class="deschide"> the direction and order of history, and how they organized and calculated time in their communities. We will also consider how ancient Jews and Christians came to reject classical conceptions of time and how this rejection still informs modern ideas about time and history.</span><br/>
