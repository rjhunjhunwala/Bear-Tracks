				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The undergraduate major in Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) focuses on the study of molecular structures and processes of cellular life and their roles in the function, reproduction, and development of living organisms. This covers a broad range of specialized disciplines, such as biochemistry, microbiology, biophysics, molecular biology, genetics, cell physiology, cell anatomy, immunology, and neurobiology. The types of living organisms from which the departmental faculty draws its working materials are as diverse as its disciplinary concentrations, ranging from viruses and microbes through plants, roundworms, annelids, arthropods, and mollusks, to fish, amphibia, and mammals. </p>
<p>There are five emphases (concentrations) in MCB:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Biochemistry and Molecular Biology</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Cell and Developmental Biology</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Genetics, Genomics, and Development</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Immunology and Pathogenesis</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Neurobiology</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All of the emphases except Neurobiology have two tracks to choose from. Some tracks only differ slightly and some give a whole different perspective on the emphasis. For help deciding your emphasis please see a staff or peer advisor in MCB!</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students can receive pre-major advising at any time from staff or peer advisors. MCB is not an impacted major. Therefore, the major will accept any interested student who meets the minimum course and GPA requirements and is realistically able to complete the major requirements during the student's time at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>In order to declare the MCB major, students must have completed or be enrolled in <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=BIOLOGY%201A">BIOLOGY 1A</a>/<a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=BIOLOGY%201AL">BIOLOGY 1AL</a> (C or better on first Bio 1A midterm) and <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=CHEM%203B">CHEM 3B</a> (past the early drop deadline), have at least a 2.0 overall GPA, a 2.0 GPA in the courses taken for the major, a 2.0 GPA in any upper division courses taken for the major, and know which emphasis they will declare. Intended MCB students are not required to have completed the math, physics, or Bio 1B requirements at the time of declaration (though these requirements must be met in order to graduate).</p>
<p>To start the major declaration process, students must fill out the <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/declaring">MCB major declaration form online</a>.</p>
<p>Once the declaration form has been processed, students will receive an email with instructions to schedule an appointment to meet with a staff advisor. Advising appointments take place in the Undergraduate Advising Office in 3060 Valley Life Sciences Building. Students should bring a printed copy of their Academic Summary in CalCentral to their advising appointment to discuss their academic plan. See full instructions on the <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/declaring">MCB Declaration page</a>.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

			<div id="studentlearninggoalstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Department of Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) is a large department that is subdivided into five divisions: Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology (BBS); Cell and Developmental Biology (CDB); Genetics, Genomics and Development (GGD); Immunology and Pathogenesis (IMMP); and Neurobiology (NEU). All MCB students complete the same lower division coursework to gain critical training in biology, mathematics, chemistry, and physics. All or most lower division coursework is completed before major declaration. Upon declaring the major, MCB students choose an emphasis, or specialization, which determines the upper division core courses they will take and elective choices from which they will choose. Students can choose among several areas of specialization; emphases are broadly defined along divisional lines and allow students to focus on a more defined topic within MCB. MCB students who elect to participate in independent research may choose from sponsoring research laboratories within any MCB division, or in laboratories outside the department (other Berkeley departments, LBNL, CHORI, UCSF, biotechnology companies). The MCB major provides excellent preparation for many careers and postbaccalaureate training programs, including graduate programs and health-related professional programs (e.g., medicine, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy), science writing, law school, biotechnology, teaching, and academic research.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Describe basic biological concepts and principles.</li>
	<li>Appreciate the different levels of biological organization, from molecules to ecosystems.</li>
	<li>Understand that biology has a chemical, physical, and mathematical basis.</li>
	<li>Explain the importance of the scientific method to understanding natural phenomena.</li>
	<li>Effectively communicate scientific data and ideas, both orally and in writing.</li>
	<li>Critically evaluate data, develop a hypothesis, and design experiments to address an interesting and novel problem.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate advanced knowledge in a specialized field of molecular and cell biology.</li>
</ol>
			</div>
			<div id="advisingtextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><p>MCB offers three types of undergraduate advising: staff advisers, faculty advisors, and peer advisors.</p>
<h3>Staff Advisers</h3>
<p>Staff academic advisors are trained to support students and assist them in successfully completing their MCB major. They are excellent resources for questions concerning administration and academics, or finding out about other available services. Students should see a staff adviser for the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ask questions about major requirements.</li>
	<li>Ask advice about schedule planning.</li>
	<li>Declare the MCB major.</li>
	<li>Consult about research opportunities, graduate and professional schools, career opportunities, scholarships, and internships.</li>
	<li>Get information and course control numbers (CCN's) for independent research.</li>
	<li>Request general assistance, advice or information.</li>
	<li>Find out about upcoming events and programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff advisers are primarily available for drop-in advising, though limited appointments are available for more complex issues such as probation, academic difficulty, and readmission. If students would like to schedule an appointment, they should call 510-643-8895 during drop-in advising hours.</p>
<p>The general email address is <a href="mailto:mcbuao@berkeley.edu">mcbuao@berkeley.edu</a> which is checked daily, Monday through Friday, so students will receive an answer to questions within one business day.</p>
<h3>Faculty Advisers</h3>
<p>Faculty advisors are MCB professors assigned to advise students about the MCB department, its courses, its research, and other academic issues. Students typically first meet with a faculty advisor when they declare an MCB major. Students should see their faculty advisers for the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Receive guidance toward achieving academic and career goals.</li>
	<li>Ask questions about the content of MCB courses.</li>
	<li>Ask questions about biological research and about the field of biology in general.</li>
	<li>Ask for recommendations on which graduate schools to attend.</li>
	<li>Review and approve major declaration plan after speaking with a UAO staff adviser.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a list of advisors and their office hours, please see the <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/advising/advising-office/advising-services/" target="_blank">department's website</a>. Office hours listed are designated for drop-in advising unless otherwise noted. Faculty adviser office hours are effective from the first day of instruction until the final day of instruction for the fall and spring semesters. Faculty advisers are not available for office hours during winter or summer break. Students may refer to staff drop-in advising hours during summer sessions and non-instructional periods.</p>
<h3>Peer Adviser Walk-in Services (PAWS)</h3>
<p>Peer advisers are junior and senior MCB majors who volunteer their time to complement the UAO advising services by sharing their knowledge of and experience with lower division requirements and upper division classes, experience with student groups on campus, preparation for life beyond the BA, and use of various campus resources. To see the schedule and more information about who the peer advisers are and which courses they have taken, click <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/PAWS" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="academicopportunitiestextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
<p>Under the guidance of a faculty member and/or research mentor, undergraduates in the MCB major may have the opportunity to work in a laboratory to gain valuable experience in scientific research. Interested students must take the initiative to make such arrangements. Over forty percent of MCB majors work in a lab to gain valuable experience in scientific research. To get started, students should talk with classmates, peer advisers, a staff undergraduate adviser, graduate student instructors (GSIs), and faculty about their interest in learning more about laboratory research. For more information on research, see <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/research/research/lab" target="_blank" title="how to find a lab position">How to Find a Lab Position</a>.</p>
<p>Benefits of research:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Science is a way to figure things out, so doing research will aid students in other aspects of their life. Students will ask and answer open ended questions and link seemingly disconnected pieces of information to find results that were not predicted.</li>
	<li>Explore things at the cutting edge and that no one has explored before.</li>
	<li>Learn tenacity, problem solving, and to be critical about the details because things have to be reproducible. </li>
	<li>Solve mysteries and experience the excitement of discovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students may receive academic credit for their work by enrolling in an independent study course: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%2099" title="MCELLBI 99" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI 99');">MCELLBI 99</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20199" title="MCELLBI 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI 199');">MCELLBI 199</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20H196A" title="MCELLBI H196A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI H196A');">MCELLBI H196A</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20H196B" title="MCELLBI H196B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI H196B');">MCELLBI H196B</a></span>. Enrollment applications are due in the Undergraduate Advising Office by the fifth week of each semester.</p>

<h3>Honors Program</h3>

That is the fundamental issue in all science, and is frequently overlooked in many media accounts of science. A second objective is to learn enough of the language of biology to be able to ask the kind of informed questions that we would want all elected representatives to pay attention to. A third objective is for students to cultivate confidence that through non-specialized information sources they can become informed consumers of contemporary scientific thought, and to develop those habits of intellect to think about evidence in a scientific manner. A fourth objective is for students to enjoy the abundance of high quality books, articles and multimedia that will enable a lifetime of discovery outside the structure of a college course.<br/></p></div>

This lab course is an introduction to mammalian neuroanatomy for non-MCB majors. We will do dissections, explore physical anatomical models, and observe microscopic structures within preserved brain slices from a variety of mammalian species. The hands-on exploration of anatomy is key to understanding how the different functional regions of the nervous system are interconnected. Besides gaining a better understanding</span><span class="deschide"> of anatomy, you will gain important scientific skills such as conducting parts of a neurological exam, fluorescent and light microscopy, reading MRI scans and conducting fine dissections. The course will culminate with a group project using the online Allen Brain Atlas to investigate a novel scientific question.</span><br/>

We will work with a variety of datasets that describe a molecular view of cells and how they divide. We will learn about the processes that cause cells to become specialized (differentiate) and to give rise to cancer (transform). We will analyze data on genetic mutations in cancer that distinguish tumor cells from normal cells. We will learn how mutations are detected by the immune system and the basis of cancer immunotherapy. Finally we will analyze</span><span class="deschide"> data on clinical trials of cancer immunotherapy to define the correlates of success in curing the disease. The students are expected to gain an understanding of data that reveals the basics of cell physiology and cancer, how immunotherapies of cancer work and their current limitations.</span><br/>

The prevailing mutation theory holds that 3-6 gene mutations convert normal to cancer cells. But, this theory does not explain why cancers: 1) are autonomous and immortal – unlike any conventional mutations; 2) have individual clonal karyotypes and parallel clonal transcriptomes – much like conventional species; 3) Carcinogens generate cancer only after conspicuous latent periods of years to decades – but mutations change phenotypes immediately;</span><span class="deschide"> 4) are at once clonal and heterogeneous within clonal margins; and 5) form metastatic and drug-resistant subspecies with variant karyotypes. To explain these unexplained characteristics, this course tests a new theory that carcinogenesis is a form of speciation.</span><br/>

Research in our lab is focused on the cell biology of mammalian fertilization. Our lab uses biophysical, biochemical, and molecular genetics methods to study sperm ion channels and transporters that regulate sperm motility, chemotaxis, and the acrosome reaction. A better understanding of these processes will eventually lead to the development of effective tools to control and preserve male fertility, improve the reproductive health of human</span><span class="deschide"> population worldwide, and advance family planning.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The undergraduate major in Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) focuses on the study of molecular structures and processes of cellular life and their roles in the function, reproduction, and development of living organisms. This covers a broad range of specialized disciplines, such as biochemistry, microbiology, biophysics, molecular biology, genetics, cell physiology, cell anatomy, immunology, and neurobiology. The types of living organisms from which the departmental faculty draws its working materials are as diverse as its disciplinary concentrations, ranging from viruses and microbes through plants, roundworms, annelids, arthropods, and mollusks, to fish, amphibia, and mammals. </p>
<p>There are five emphases (concentrations) in MCB:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Biochemistry and Molecular Biology</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Cell and Developmental Biology</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Genetics, Genomics, and Development</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Immunology and Pathogenesis</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Neurobiology</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All of the emphases except Neurobiology have two tracks to choose from. Some tracks only differ slightly and some give a whole different perspective on the emphasis. For help deciding your emphasis please see a staff or peer advisor in MCB!</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students can receive pre-major advising at any time from staff or peer advisors. MCB is not an impacted major. Therefore, the major will accept any interested student who meets the minimum course and GPA requirements and is realistically able to complete the major requirements during the student's time at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>In order to declare the MCB major, students must have completed or be enrolled in <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=BIOLOGY%201A">BIOLOGY 1A</a>/<a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=BIOLOGY%201AL">BIOLOGY 1AL</a> (C or better on first Bio 1A midterm) and <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=CHEM%203B">CHEM 3B</a> (past the early drop deadline), have at least a 2.0 overall GPA, a 2.0 GPA in the courses taken for the major, a 2.0 GPA in any upper division courses taken for the major, and know which emphasis they will declare. Intended MCB students are not required to have completed the math, physics, or Bio 1B requirements at the time of declaration (though these requirements must be met in order to graduate).</p>
<p>To start the major declaration process, students must fill out the <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/declaring">MCB major declaration form online</a>.</p>
<p>Once the declaration form has been processed, students will receive an email with instructions to schedule an appointment to meet with a staff advisor. Advising appointments take place in the Undergraduate Advising Office in 3060 Valley Life Sciences Building. Students should bring a printed copy of their Academic Summary in CalCentral to their advising appointment to discuss their academic plan. See full instructions on the <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/declaring">MCB Declaration page</a>.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Department of Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) is a large department that is subdivided into five divisions: Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology (BBS); Cell and Developmental Biology (CDB); Genetics, Genomics and Development (GGD); Immunology and Pathogenesis (IMMP); and Neurobiology (NEU). All MCB students complete the same lower division coursework to gain critical training in biology, mathematics, chemistry, and physics. All or most lower division coursework is completed before major declaration. Upon declaring the major, MCB students choose an emphasis, or specialization, which determines the upper division core courses they will take and elective choices from which they will choose. Students can choose among several areas of specialization; emphases are broadly defined along divisional lines and allow students to focus on a more defined topic within MCB. MCB students who elect to participate in independent research may choose from sponsoring research laboratories within any MCB division, or in laboratories outside the department (other Berkeley departments, LBNL, CHORI, UCSF, biotechnology companies). The MCB major provides excellent preparation for many careers and postbaccalaureate training programs, including graduate programs and health-related professional programs (e.g., medicine, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy), science writing, law school, biotechnology, teaching, and academic research.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Describe basic biological concepts and principles.</li>
	<li>Appreciate the different levels of biological organization, from molecules to ecosystems.</li>
	<li>Understand that biology has a chemical, physical, and mathematical basis.</li>
	<li>Explain the importance of the scientific method to understanding natural phenomena.</li>
	<li>Effectively communicate scientific data and ideas, both orally and in writing.</li>
	<li>Critically evaluate data, develop a hypothesis, and design experiments to address an interesting and novel problem.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate advanced knowledge in a specialized field of molecular and cell biology.</li>
</ol>
			</div>
			<div id="advisingtextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><p>MCB offers three types of undergraduate advising: staff advisers, faculty advisors, and peer advisors.</p>
<h3>Staff Advisers</h3>
<p>Staff academic advisors are trained to support students and assist them in successfully completing their MCB major. They are excellent resources for questions concerning administration and academics, or finding out about other available services. Students should see a staff adviser for the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ask questions about major requirements.</li>
	<li>Ask advice about schedule planning.</li>
	<li>Declare the MCB major.</li>
	<li>Consult about research opportunities, graduate and professional schools, career opportunities, scholarships, and internships.</li>
	<li>Get information and course control numbers (CCN's) for independent research.</li>
	<li>Request general assistance, advice or information.</li>
	<li>Find out about upcoming events and programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff advisers are primarily available for drop-in advising, though limited appointments are available for more complex issues such as probation, academic difficulty, and readmission. If students would like to schedule an appointment, they should call 510-643-8895 during drop-in advising hours.</p>
<p>The general email address is <a href="mailto:mcbuao@berkeley.edu">mcbuao@berkeley.edu</a> which is checked daily, Monday through Friday, so students will receive an answer to questions within one business day.</p>
<h3>Faculty Advisers</h3>
<p>Faculty advisors are MCB professors assigned to advise students about the MCB department, its courses, its research, and other academic issues. Students typically first meet with a faculty advisor when they declare an MCB major. Students should see their faculty advisers for the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Receive guidance toward achieving academic and career goals.</li>
	<li>Ask questions about the content of MCB courses.</li>
	<li>Ask questions about biological research and about the field of biology in general.</li>
	<li>Ask for recommendations on which graduate schools to attend.</li>
	<li>Review and approve major declaration plan after speaking with a UAO staff adviser.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a list of advisors and their office hours, please see the <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/advising/advising-office/advising-services/" target="_blank">department's website</a>. Office hours listed are designated for drop-in advising unless otherwise noted. Faculty adviser office hours are effective from the first day of instruction until the final day of instruction for the fall and spring semesters. Faculty advisers are not available for office hours during winter or summer break. Students may refer to staff drop-in advising hours during summer sessions and non-instructional periods.</p>
<h3>Peer Adviser Walk-in Services (PAWS)</h3>
<p>Peer advisers are junior and senior MCB majors who volunteer their time to complement the UAO advising services by sharing their knowledge of and experience with lower division requirements and upper division classes, experience with student groups on campus, preparation for life beyond the BA, and use of various campus resources. To see the schedule and more information about who the peer advisers are and which courses they have taken, click <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/PAWS" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="academicopportunitiestextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
<p>Under the guidance of a faculty member and/or research mentor, undergraduates in the MCB major may have the opportunity to work in a laboratory to gain valuable experience in scientific research. Interested students must take the initiative to make such arrangements. Over forty percent of MCB majors work in a lab to gain valuable experience in scientific research. To get started, students should talk with classmates, peer advisers, a staff undergraduate adviser, graduate student instructors (GSIs), and faculty about their interest in learning more about laboratory research. For more information on research, see <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/research/research/lab" target="_blank" title="how to find a lab position">How to Find a Lab Position</a>.</p>
<p>Benefits of research:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Science is a way to figure things out, so doing research will aid students in other aspects of their life. Students will ask and answer open ended questions and link seemingly disconnected pieces of information to find results that were not predicted.</li>
	<li>Explore things at the cutting edge and that no one has explored before.</li>
	<li>Learn tenacity, problem solving, and to be critical about the details because things have to be reproducible. </li>
	<li>Solve mysteries and experience the excitement of discovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students may receive academic credit for their work by enrolling in an independent study course: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%2099" title="MCELLBI 99" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI 99');">MCELLBI 99</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20199" title="MCELLBI 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI 199');">MCELLBI 199</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20H196A" title="MCELLBI H196A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI H196A');">MCELLBI H196A</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20H196B" title="MCELLBI H196B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI H196B');">MCELLBI H196B</a></span>. Enrollment applications are due in the Undergraduate Advising Office by the fifth week of each semester.</p>

<h3>Honors Program</h3>

That is the fundamental issue in all science, and is frequently overlooked in many media accounts of science. A second objective is to learn enough of the language of biology to be able to ask the kind of informed questions that we would want all elected representatives to pay attention to. A third objective is for students to cultivate confidence that through non-specialized information sources they can become informed consumers of contemporary scientific thought, and to develop those habits of intellect to think about evidence in a scientific manner. A fourth objective is for students to enjoy the abundance of high quality books, articles and multimedia that will enable a lifetime of discovery outside the structure of a college course.<br/></p></div>

The prevailing mutation theory holds that 3-6 gene mutations convert normal to cancer cells. But, this theory does not explain why cancers: 1) are autonomous and immortal – unlike any conventional mutations; 2) have individual clonal karyotypes and parallel clonal transcriptomes – much like conventional species; 3) Carcinogens generate cancer only after conspicuous latent periods of years to decades – but mutations change phenotypes immediately;</span><span class="deschide"> 4) are at once clonal and heterogeneous within clonal margins; and 5) form metastatic and drug-resistant subspecies with variant karyotypes. To explain these unexplained characteristics, this course tests a new theory that carcinogenesis is a form of speciation.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The undergraduate major in Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) focuses on the study of molecular structures and processes of cellular life and their roles in the function, reproduction, and development of living organisms. This covers a broad range of specialized disciplines, such as biochemistry, microbiology, biophysics, molecular biology, genetics, cell physiology, cell anatomy, immunology, and neurobiology. The types of living organisms from which the departmental faculty draws its working materials are as diverse as its disciplinary concentrations, ranging from viruses and microbes through plants, roundworms, annelids, arthropods, and mollusks, to fish, amphibia, and mammals. </p>
<p>There are five emphases (concentrations) in MCB:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Biochemistry and Molecular Biology</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Cell and Developmental Biology</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Genetics, Genomics, and Development</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Immunology and Pathogenesis</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Neurobiology</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All of the emphases except Neurobiology have two tracks to choose from. Some tracks only differ slightly and some give a whole different perspective on the emphasis. For help deciding your emphasis please see a staff or peer advisor in MCB!</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students can receive pre-major advising at any time from staff or peer advisors. MCB is not an impacted major. Therefore, the major will accept any interested student who meets the minimum course and GPA requirements and is realistically able to complete the major requirements during the student's time at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>In order to declare the MCB major, students must have completed or be enrolled in <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=BIOLOGY%201A">BIOLOGY 1A</a>/<a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=BIOLOGY%201AL">BIOLOGY 1AL</a> (C or better on first Bio 1A midterm) and <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=CHEM%203B">CHEM 3B</a> (past the early drop deadline), have at least a 2.0 overall GPA, a 2.0 GPA in the courses taken for the major, a 2.0 GPA in any upper division courses taken for the major, and know which emphasis they will declare. Intended MCB students are not required to have completed the math, physics, or Bio 1B requirements at the time of declaration (though these requirements must be met in order to graduate).</p>
<p>To start the major declaration process, students must fill out the <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/declaring">MCB major declaration form online</a>.</p>
<p>Once the declaration form has been processed, students will receive an email with instructions to schedule an appointment to meet with a staff advisor. Advising appointments take place in the Undergraduate Advising Office in 3060 Valley Life Sciences Building. Students should bring a printed copy of their Academic Summary in CalCentral to their advising appointment to discuss their academic plan. See full instructions on the <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/declaring">MCB Declaration page</a>.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

			<div id="studentlearninggoalstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Department of Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) is a large department that is subdivided into five divisions: Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology (BBS); Cell and Developmental Biology (CDB); Genetics, Genomics and Development (GGD); Immunology and Pathogenesis (IMMP); and Neurobiology (NEU). All MCB students complete the same lower division coursework to gain critical training in biology, mathematics, chemistry, and physics. All or most lower division coursework is completed before major declaration. Upon declaring the major, MCB students choose an emphasis, or specialization, which determines the upper division core courses they will take and elective choices from which they will choose. Students can choose among several areas of specialization; emphases are broadly defined along divisional lines and allow students to focus on a more defined topic within MCB. MCB students who elect to participate in independent research may choose from sponsoring research laboratories within any MCB division, or in laboratories outside the department (other Berkeley departments, LBNL, CHORI, UCSF, biotechnology companies). The MCB major provides excellent preparation for many careers and postbaccalaureate training programs, including graduate programs and health-related professional programs (e.g., medicine, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy), science writing, law school, biotechnology, teaching, and academic research.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Describe basic biological concepts and principles.</li>
	<li>Appreciate the different levels of biological organization, from molecules to ecosystems.</li>
	<li>Understand that biology has a chemical, physical, and mathematical basis.</li>
	<li>Explain the importance of the scientific method to understanding natural phenomena.</li>
	<li>Effectively communicate scientific data and ideas, both orally and in writing.</li>
	<li>Critically evaluate data, develop a hypothesis, and design experiments to address an interesting and novel problem.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate advanced knowledge in a specialized field of molecular and cell biology.</li>
</ol>
			</div>
			<div id="advisingtextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><p>MCB offers three types of undergraduate advising: staff advisers, faculty advisors, and peer advisors.</p>
<h3>Staff Advisers</h3>
<p>Staff academic advisors are trained to support students and assist them in successfully completing their MCB major. They are excellent resources for questions concerning administration and academics, or finding out about other available services. Students should see a staff adviser for the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ask questions about major requirements.</li>
	<li>Ask advice about schedule planning.</li>
	<li>Declare the MCB major.</li>
	<li>Consult about research opportunities, graduate and professional schools, career opportunities, scholarships, and internships.</li>
	<li>Get information and course control numbers (CCN's) for independent research.</li>
	<li>Request general assistance, advice or information.</li>
	<li>Find out about upcoming events and programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff advisers are primarily available for drop-in advising, though limited appointments are available for more complex issues such as probation, academic difficulty, and readmission. If students would like to schedule an appointment, they should call 510-643-8895 during drop-in advising hours.</p>
<p>The general email address is <a href="mailto:mcbuao@berkeley.edu">mcbuao@berkeley.edu</a> which is checked daily, Monday through Friday, so students will receive an answer to questions within one business day.</p>
<h3>Faculty Advisers</h3>
<p>Faculty advisors are MCB professors assigned to advise students about the MCB department, its courses, its research, and other academic issues. Students typically first meet with a faculty advisor when they declare an MCB major. Students should see their faculty advisers for the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Receive guidance toward achieving academic and career goals.</li>
	<li>Ask questions about the content of MCB courses.</li>
	<li>Ask questions about biological research and about the field of biology in general.</li>
	<li>Ask for recommendations on which graduate schools to attend.</li>
	<li>Review and approve major declaration plan after speaking with a UAO staff adviser.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a list of advisors and their office hours, please see the <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/advising/advising-office/advising-services/" target="_blank">department's website</a>. Office hours listed are designated for drop-in advising unless otherwise noted. Faculty adviser office hours are effective from the first day of instruction until the final day of instruction for the fall and spring semesters. Faculty advisers are not available for office hours during winter or summer break. Students may refer to staff drop-in advising hours during summer sessions and non-instructional periods.</p>
<h3>Peer Adviser Walk-in Services (PAWS)</h3>
<p>Peer advisers are junior and senior MCB majors who volunteer their time to complement the UAO advising services by sharing their knowledge of and experience with lower division requirements and upper division classes, experience with student groups on campus, preparation for life beyond the BA, and use of various campus resources. To see the schedule and more information about who the peer advisers are and which courses they have taken, click <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/PAWS" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="academicopportunitiestextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
<p>Under the guidance of a faculty member and/or research mentor, undergraduates in the MCB major may have the opportunity to work in a laboratory to gain valuable experience in scientific research. Interested students must take the initiative to make such arrangements. Over forty percent of MCB majors work in a lab to gain valuable experience in scientific research. To get started, students should talk with classmates, peer advisers, a staff undergraduate adviser, graduate student instructors (GSIs), and faculty about their interest in learning more about laboratory research. For more information on research, see <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/research/research/lab" target="_blank" title="how to find a lab position">How to Find a Lab Position</a>.</p>
<p>Benefits of research:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Science is a way to figure things out, so doing research will aid students in other aspects of their life. Students will ask and answer open ended questions and link seemingly disconnected pieces of information to find results that were not predicted.</li>
	<li>Explore things at the cutting edge and that no one has explored before.</li>
	<li>Learn tenacity, problem solving, and to be critical about the details because things have to be reproducible. </li>
	<li>Solve mysteries and experience the excitement of discovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students may receive academic credit for their work by enrolling in an independent study course: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%2099" title="MCELLBI 99" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI 99');">MCELLBI 99</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20199" title="MCELLBI 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI 199');">MCELLBI 199</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20H196A" title="MCELLBI H196A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI H196A');">MCELLBI H196A</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20H196B" title="MCELLBI H196B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI H196B');">MCELLBI H196B</a></span>. Enrollment applications are due in the Undergraduate Advising Office by the fifth week of each semester.</p>

<h3>Honors Program</h3>

That is the fundamental issue in all science, and is frequently overlooked in many media accounts of science. A second objective is to learn enough of the language of biology to be able to ask the kind of informed questions that we would want all elected representatives to pay attention to. A third objective is for students to cultivate confidence that through non-specialized information sources they can become informed consumers of contemporary scientific thought, and to develop those habits of intellect to think about evidence in a scientific manner. A fourth objective is for students to enjoy the abundance of high quality books, articles and multimedia that will enable a lifetime of discovery outside the structure of a college course.<br/></p></div>

This lab course is an introduction to mammalian neuroanatomy for non-MCB majors. We will do dissections, explore physical anatomical models, and observe microscopic structures within preserved brain slices from a variety of mammalian species. The hands-on exploration of anatomy is key to understanding how the different functional regions of the nervous system are interconnected. Besides gaining a better understanding</span><span class="deschide"> of anatomy, you will gain important scientific skills such as conducting parts of a neurological exam, fluorescent and light microscopy, reading MRI scans and conducting fine dissections. The course will culminate with a group project using the online Allen Brain Atlas to investigate a novel scientific question.</span><br/>

We will work with a variety of datasets that describe a molecular view of cells and how they divide. We will learn about the processes that cause cells to become specialized (differentiate) and to give rise to cancer (transform). We will analyze data on genetic mutations in cancer that distinguish tumor cells from normal cells. We will learn how mutations are detected by the immune system and the basis of cancer immunotherapy. Finally we will analyze</span><span class="deschide"> data on clinical trials of cancer immunotherapy to define the correlates of success in curing the disease. The students are expected to gain an understanding of data that reveals the basics of cell physiology and cancer, how immunotherapies of cancer work and their current limitations.</span><br/>

The prevailing mutation theory holds that 3-6 gene mutations convert normal to cancer cells. But, this theory does not explain why cancers: 1) are autonomous and immortal – unlike any conventional mutations; 2) have individual clonal karyotypes and parallel clonal transcriptomes – much like conventional species; 3) Carcinogens generate cancer only after conspicuous latent periods of years to decades – but mutations change phenotypes immediately;</span><span class="deschide"> 4) are at once clonal and heterogeneous within clonal margins; and 5) form metastatic and drug-resistant subspecies with variant karyotypes. To explain these unexplained characteristics, this course tests a new theory that carcinogenesis is a form of speciation.</span><br/>

Research in our lab is focused on the cell biology of mammalian fertilization. Our lab uses biophysical, biochemical, and molecular genetics methods to study sperm ion channels and transporters that regulate sperm motility, chemotaxis, and the acrosome reaction. A better understanding of these processes will eventually lead to the development of effective tools to control and preserve male fertility, improve the reproductive health of human</span><span class="deschide"> population worldwide, and advance family planning.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The undergraduate major in Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) focuses on the study of molecular structures and processes of cellular life and their roles in the function, reproduction, and development of living organisms. This covers a broad range of specialized disciplines, such as biochemistry, microbiology, biophysics, molecular biology, genetics, cell physiology, cell anatomy, immunology, and neurobiology. The types of living organisms from which the departmental faculty draws its working materials are as diverse as its disciplinary concentrations, ranging from viruses and microbes through plants, roundworms, annelids, arthropods, and mollusks, to fish, amphibia, and mammals. </p>
<p>There are five emphases (concentrations) in MCB:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Biochemistry and Molecular Biology</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Cell and Developmental Biology</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Genetics, Genomics, and Development</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Immunology and Pathogenesis</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Neurobiology</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All of the emphases except Neurobiology have two tracks to choose from. Some tracks only differ slightly and some give a whole different perspective on the emphasis. For help deciding your emphasis please see a staff or peer advisor in MCB!</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students can receive pre-major advising at any time from staff or peer advisors. MCB is not an impacted major. Therefore, the major will accept any interested student who meets the minimum course and GPA requirements and is realistically able to complete the major requirements during the student's time at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>In order to declare the MCB major, students must have completed or be enrolled in <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=BIOLOGY%201A">BIOLOGY 1A</a>/<a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=BIOLOGY%201AL">BIOLOGY 1AL</a> (C or better on first Bio 1A midterm) and <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=CHEM%203B">CHEM 3B</a> (past the early drop deadline), have at least a 2.0 overall GPA, a 2.0 GPA in the courses taken for the major, a 2.0 GPA in any upper division courses taken for the major, and know which emphasis they will declare. Intended MCB students are not required to have completed the math, physics, or Bio 1B requirements at the time of declaration (though these requirements must be met in order to graduate).</p>
<p>To start the major declaration process, students must fill out the <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/declaring">MCB major declaration form online</a>.</p>
<p>Once the declaration form has been processed, students will receive an email with instructions to schedule an appointment to meet with a staff advisor. Advising appointments take place in the Undergraduate Advising Office in 3060 Valley Life Sciences Building. Students should bring a printed copy of their Academic Summary in CalCentral to their advising appointment to discuss their academic plan. See full instructions on the <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/declaring">MCB Declaration page</a>.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Department of Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) is a large department that is subdivided into five divisions: Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology (BBS); Cell and Developmental Biology (CDB); Genetics, Genomics and Development (GGD); Immunology and Pathogenesis (IMMP); and Neurobiology (NEU). All MCB students complete the same lower division coursework to gain critical training in biology, mathematics, chemistry, and physics. All or most lower division coursework is completed before major declaration. Upon declaring the major, MCB students choose an emphasis, or specialization, which determines the upper division core courses they will take and elective choices from which they will choose. Students can choose among several areas of specialization; emphases are broadly defined along divisional lines and allow students to focus on a more defined topic within MCB. MCB students who elect to participate in independent research may choose from sponsoring research laboratories within any MCB division, or in laboratories outside the department (other Berkeley departments, LBNL, CHORI, UCSF, biotechnology companies). The MCB major provides excellent preparation for many careers and postbaccalaureate training programs, including graduate programs and health-related professional programs (e.g., medicine, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy), science writing, law school, biotechnology, teaching, and academic research.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Describe basic biological concepts and principles.</li>
	<li>Appreciate the different levels of biological organization, from molecules to ecosystems.</li>
	<li>Understand that biology has a chemical, physical, and mathematical basis.</li>
	<li>Explain the importance of the scientific method to understanding natural phenomena.</li>
	<li>Effectively communicate scientific data and ideas, both orally and in writing.</li>
	<li>Critically evaluate data, develop a hypothesis, and design experiments to address an interesting and novel problem.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate advanced knowledge in a specialized field of molecular and cell biology.</li>
</ol>
			</div>
			<div id="advisingtextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><p>MCB offers three types of undergraduate advising: staff advisers, faculty advisors, and peer advisors.</p>
<h3>Staff Advisers</h3>
<p>Staff academic advisors are trained to support students and assist them in successfully completing their MCB major. They are excellent resources for questions concerning administration and academics, or finding out about other available services. Students should see a staff adviser for the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ask questions about major requirements.</li>
	<li>Ask advice about schedule planning.</li>
	<li>Declare the MCB major.</li>
	<li>Consult about research opportunities, graduate and professional schools, career opportunities, scholarships, and internships.</li>
	<li>Get information and course control numbers (CCN's) for independent research.</li>
	<li>Request general assistance, advice or information.</li>
	<li>Find out about upcoming events and programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff advisers are primarily available for drop-in advising, though limited appointments are available for more complex issues such as probation, academic difficulty, and readmission. If students would like to schedule an appointment, they should call 510-643-8895 during drop-in advising hours.</p>
<p>The general email address is <a href="mailto:mcbuao@berkeley.edu">mcbuao@berkeley.edu</a> which is checked daily, Monday through Friday, so students will receive an answer to questions within one business day.</p>
<h3>Faculty Advisers</h3>
<p>Faculty advisors are MCB professors assigned to advise students about the MCB department, its courses, its research, and other academic issues. Students typically first meet with a faculty advisor when they declare an MCB major. Students should see their faculty advisers for the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Receive guidance toward achieving academic and career goals.</li>
	<li>Ask questions about the content of MCB courses.</li>
	<li>Ask questions about biological research and about the field of biology in general.</li>
	<li>Ask for recommendations on which graduate schools to attend.</li>
	<li>Review and approve major declaration plan after speaking with a UAO staff adviser.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a list of advisors and their office hours, please see the <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/advising/advising-office/advising-services/" target="_blank">department's website</a>. Office hours listed are designated for drop-in advising unless otherwise noted. Faculty adviser office hours are effective from the first day of instruction until the final day of instruction for the fall and spring semesters. Faculty advisers are not available for office hours during winter or summer break. Students may refer to staff drop-in advising hours during summer sessions and non-instructional periods.</p>
<h3>Peer Adviser Walk-in Services (PAWS)</h3>
<p>Peer advisers are junior and senior MCB majors who volunteer their time to complement the UAO advising services by sharing their knowledge of and experience with lower division requirements and upper division classes, experience with student groups on campus, preparation for life beyond the BA, and use of various campus resources. To see the schedule and more information about who the peer advisers are and which courses they have taken, click <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/PAWS" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="academicopportunitiestextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
<p>Under the guidance of a faculty member and/or research mentor, undergraduates in the MCB major may have the opportunity to work in a laboratory to gain valuable experience in scientific research. Interested students must take the initiative to make such arrangements. Over forty percent of MCB majors work in a lab to gain valuable experience in scientific research. To get started, students should talk with classmates, peer advisers, a staff undergraduate adviser, graduate student instructors (GSIs), and faculty about their interest in learning more about laboratory research. For more information on research, see <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/research/research/lab" target="_blank" title="how to find a lab position">How to Find a Lab Position</a>.</p>
<p>Benefits of research:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Science is a way to figure things out, so doing research will aid students in other aspects of their life. Students will ask and answer open ended questions and link seemingly disconnected pieces of information to find results that were not predicted.</li>
	<li>Explore things at the cutting edge and that no one has explored before.</li>
	<li>Learn tenacity, problem solving, and to be critical about the details because things have to be reproducible. </li>
	<li>Solve mysteries and experience the excitement of discovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students may receive academic credit for their work by enrolling in an independent study course: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%2099" title="MCELLBI 99" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI 99');">MCELLBI 99</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20199" title="MCELLBI 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI 199');">MCELLBI 199</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20H196A" title="MCELLBI H196A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI H196A');">MCELLBI H196A</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20H196B" title="MCELLBI H196B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI H196B');">MCELLBI H196B</a></span>. Enrollment applications are due in the Undergraduate Advising Office by the fifth week of each semester.</p>

<h3>Honors Program</h3>

That is the fundamental issue in all science, and is frequently overlooked in many media accounts of science. A second objective is to learn enough of the language of biology to be able to ask the kind of informed questions that we would want all elected representatives to pay attention to. A third objective is for students to cultivate confidence that through non-specialized information sources they can become informed consumers of contemporary scientific thought, and to develop those habits of intellect to think about evidence in a scientific manner. A fourth objective is for students to enjoy the abundance of high quality books, articles and multimedia that will enable a lifetime of discovery outside the structure of a college course.<br/></p></div>

The prevailing mutation theory holds that 3-6 gene mutations convert normal to cancer cells. But, this theory does not explain why cancers: 1) are autonomous and immortal – unlike any conventional mutations; 2) have individual clonal karyotypes and parallel clonal transcriptomes – much like conventional species; 3) Carcinogens generate cancer only after conspicuous latent periods of years to decades – but mutations change phenotypes immediately;</span><span class="deschide"> 4) are at once clonal and heterogeneous within clonal margins; and 5) form metastatic and drug-resistant subspecies with variant karyotypes. To explain these unexplained characteristics, this course tests a new theory that carcinogenesis is a form of speciation.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The undergraduate major in Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) focuses on the study of molecular structures and processes of cellular life and their roles in the function, reproduction, and development of living organisms. This covers a broad range of specialized disciplines, such as biochemistry, microbiology, biophysics, molecular biology, genetics, cell physiology, cell anatomy, immunology, and neurobiology. The types of living organisms from which the departmental faculty draws its working materials are as diverse as its disciplinary concentrations, ranging from viruses and microbes through plants, roundworms, annelids, arthropods, and mollusks, to fish, amphibia, and mammals. </p>
<p>There are five emphases (concentrations) in MCB:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Biochemistry and Molecular Biology</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Cell and Developmental Biology</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Genetics, Genomics, and Development</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Immunology and Pathogenesis</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-e7d3d727-7fff-174c-4bf1-3f0f25d00b0d">Neurobiology</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All of the emphases except Neurobiology have two tracks to choose from. Some tracks only differ slightly and some give a whole different perspective on the emphasis. For help deciding your emphasis please see a staff or peer advisor in MCB!</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students can receive pre-major advising at any time from staff or peer advisors. MCB is not an impacted major. Therefore, the major will accept any interested student who meets the minimum course and GPA requirements and is realistically able to complete the major requirements during the student's time at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>In order to declare the MCB major, students must have completed or be enrolled in <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=BIOLOGY%201A">BIOLOGY 1A</a>/<a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=BIOLOGY%201AL">BIOLOGY 1AL</a> (C or better on first Bio 1A midterm) and <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/search/?P=CHEM%203B">CHEM 3B</a> (past the early drop deadline), have at least a 2.0 overall GPA, a 2.0 GPA in the courses taken for the major, a 2.0 GPA in any upper division courses taken for the major, and know which emphasis they will declare. Intended MCB students are not required to have completed the math, physics, or Bio 1B requirements at the time of declaration (though these requirements must be met in order to graduate).</p>
<p>To start the major declaration process, students must fill out the <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/declaring">MCB major declaration form online</a>.</p>
<p>Once the declaration form has been processed, students will receive an email with instructions to schedule an appointment to meet with a staff advisor. Advising appointments take place in the Undergraduate Advising Office in 3060 Valley Life Sciences Building. Students should bring a printed copy of their Academic Summary in CalCentral to their advising appointment to discuss their academic plan. See full instructions on the <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/declaring">MCB Declaration page</a>.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

			<div id="studentlearninggoalstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Department of Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) is a large department that is subdivided into five divisions: Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology (BBS); Cell and Developmental Biology (CDB); Genetics, Genomics and Development (GGD); Immunology and Pathogenesis (IMMP); and Neurobiology (NEU). All MCB students complete the same lower division coursework to gain critical training in biology, mathematics, chemistry, and physics. All or most lower division coursework is completed before major declaration. Upon declaring the major, MCB students choose an emphasis, or specialization, which determines the upper division core courses they will take and elective choices from which they will choose. Students can choose among several areas of specialization; emphases are broadly defined along divisional lines and allow students to focus on a more defined topic within MCB. MCB students who elect to participate in independent research may choose from sponsoring research laboratories within any MCB division, or in laboratories outside the department (other Berkeley departments, LBNL, CHORI, UCSF, biotechnology companies). The MCB major provides excellent preparation for many careers and postbaccalaureate training programs, including graduate programs and health-related professional programs (e.g., medicine, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy), science writing, law school, biotechnology, teaching, and academic research.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Describe basic biological concepts and principles.</li>
	<li>Appreciate the different levels of biological organization, from molecules to ecosystems.</li>
	<li>Understand that biology has a chemical, physical, and mathematical basis.</li>
	<li>Explain the importance of the scientific method to understanding natural phenomena.</li>
	<li>Effectively communicate scientific data and ideas, both orally and in writing.</li>
	<li>Critically evaluate data, develop a hypothesis, and design experiments to address an interesting and novel problem.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate advanced knowledge in a specialized field of molecular and cell biology.</li>
</ol>
			</div>
			<div id="advisingtextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="advisingtext"></a><h2>Advising</h2><p>MCB offers three types of undergraduate advising: staff advisers, faculty advisors, and peer advisors.</p>
<h3>Staff Advisers</h3>
<p>Staff academic advisors are trained to support students and assist them in successfully completing their MCB major. They are excellent resources for questions concerning administration and academics, or finding out about other available services. Students should see a staff adviser for the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ask questions about major requirements.</li>
	<li>Ask advice about schedule planning.</li>
	<li>Declare the MCB major.</li>
	<li>Consult about research opportunities, graduate and professional schools, career opportunities, scholarships, and internships.</li>
	<li>Get information and course control numbers (CCN's) for independent research.</li>
	<li>Request general assistance, advice or information.</li>
	<li>Find out about upcoming events and programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff advisers are primarily available for drop-in advising, though limited appointments are available for more complex issues such as probation, academic difficulty, and readmission. If students would like to schedule an appointment, they should call 510-643-8895 during drop-in advising hours.</p>
<p>The general email address is <a href="mailto:mcbuao@berkeley.edu">mcbuao@berkeley.edu</a> which is checked daily, Monday through Friday, so students will receive an answer to questions within one business day.</p>
<h3>Faculty Advisers</h3>
<p>Faculty advisors are MCB professors assigned to advise students about the MCB department, its courses, its research, and other academic issues. Students typically first meet with a faculty advisor when they declare an MCB major. Students should see their faculty advisers for the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Receive guidance toward achieving academic and career goals.</li>
	<li>Ask questions about the content of MCB courses.</li>
	<li>Ask questions about biological research and about the field of biology in general.</li>
	<li>Ask for recommendations on which graduate schools to attend.</li>
	<li>Review and approve major declaration plan after speaking with a UAO staff adviser.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a list of advisors and their office hours, please see the <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/advising/advising-office/advising-services/" target="_blank">department's website</a>. Office hours listed are designated for drop-in advising unless otherwise noted. Faculty adviser office hours are effective from the first day of instruction until the final day of instruction for the fall and spring semesters. Faculty advisers are not available for office hours during winter or summer break. Students may refer to staff drop-in advising hours during summer sessions and non-instructional periods.</p>
<h3>Peer Adviser Walk-in Services (PAWS)</h3>
<p>Peer advisers are junior and senior MCB majors who volunteer their time to complement the UAO advising services by sharing their knowledge of and experience with lower division requirements and upper division classes, experience with student groups on campus, preparation for life beyond the BA, and use of various campus resources. To see the schedule and more information about who the peer advisers are and which courses they have taken, click <a href="https://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/PAWS" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="academicopportunitiestextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="academicopportunitiestext"></a><h2>Academic Opportunities</h2><h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
<p>Under the guidance of a faculty member and/or research mentor, undergraduates in the MCB major may have the opportunity to work in a laboratory to gain valuable experience in scientific research. Interested students must take the initiative to make such arrangements. Over forty percent of MCB majors work in a lab to gain valuable experience in scientific research. To get started, students should talk with classmates, peer advisers, a staff undergraduate adviser, graduate student instructors (GSIs), and faculty about their interest in learning more about laboratory research. For more information on research, see <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/undergrad/research/research/lab" target="_blank" title="how to find a lab position">How to Find a Lab Position</a>.</p>
<p>Benefits of research:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Science is a way to figure things out, so doing research will aid students in other aspects of their life. Students will ask and answer open ended questions and link seemingly disconnected pieces of information to find results that were not predicted.</li>
	<li>Explore things at the cutting edge and that no one has explored before.</li>
	<li>Learn tenacity, problem solving, and to be critical about the details because things have to be reproducible. </li>
	<li>Solve mysteries and experience the excitement of discovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students may receive academic credit for their work by enrolling in an independent study course: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%2099" title="MCELLBI 99" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI 99');">MCELLBI 99</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20199" title="MCELLBI 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI 199');">MCELLBI 199</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20H196A" title="MCELLBI H196A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI H196A');">MCELLBI H196A</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MCELLBI%20H196B" title="MCELLBI H196B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MCELLBI H196B');">MCELLBI H196B</a></span>. Enrollment applications are due in the Undergraduate Advising Office by the fifth week of each semester.</p>

<h3>Honors Program</h3>

That is the fundamental issue in all science, and is frequently overlooked in many media accounts of science. A second objective is to learn enough of the language of biology to be able to ask the kind of informed questions that we would want all elected representatives to pay attention to. A third objective is for students to cultivate confidence that through non-specialized information sources they can become informed consumers of contemporary scientific thought, and to develop those habits of intellect to think about evidence in a scientific manner. A fourth objective is for students to enjoy the abundance of high quality books, articles and multimedia that will enable a lifetime of discovery outside the structure of a college course.<br/></p></div>

This lab course is an introduction to mammalian neuroanatomy for non-MCB majors. We will do dissections, explore physical anatomical models, and observe microscopic structures within preserved brain slices from a variety of mammalian species. The hands-on exploration of anatomy is key to understanding how the different functional regions of the nervous system are interconnected. Besides gaining a better understanding</span><span class="deschide"> of anatomy, you will gain important scientific skills such as conducting parts of a neurological exam, fluorescent and light microscopy, reading MRI scans and conducting fine dissections. The course will culminate with a group project using the online Allen Brain Atlas to investigate a novel scientific question.</span><br/>

We will work with a variety of datasets that describe a molecular view of cells and how they divide. We will learn about the processes that cause cells to become specialized (differentiate) and to give rise to cancer (transform). We will analyze data on genetic mutations in cancer that distinguish tumor cells from normal cells. We will learn how mutations are detected by the immune system and the basis of cancer immunotherapy. Finally we will analyze</span><span class="deschide"> data on clinical trials of cancer immunotherapy to define the correlates of success in curing the disease. The students are expected to gain an understanding of data that reveals the basics of cell physiology and cancer, how immunotherapies of cancer work and their current limitations.</span><br/>

The prevailing mutation theory holds that 3-6 gene mutations convert normal to cancer cells. But, this theory does not explain why cancers: 1) are autonomous and immortal – unlike any conventional mutations; 2) have individual clonal karyotypes and parallel clonal transcriptomes – much like conventional species; 3) Carcinogens generate cancer only after conspicuous latent periods of years to decades – but mutations change phenotypes immediately;</span><span class="deschide"> 4) are at once clonal and heterogeneous within clonal margins; and 5) form metastatic and drug-resistant subspecies with variant karyotypes. To explain these unexplained characteristics, this course tests a new theory that carcinogenesis is a form of speciation.</span><br/>

Research in our lab is focused on the cell biology of mammalian fertilization. Our lab uses biophysical, biochemical, and molecular genetics methods to study sperm ion channels and transporters that regulate sperm motility, chemotaxis, and the acrosome reaction. A better understanding of these processes will eventually lead to the development of effective tools to control and preserve male fertility, improve the reproductive health of human</span><span class="deschide"> population worldwide, and advance family planning.</span><br/>
