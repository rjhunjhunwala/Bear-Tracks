				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts</h3>
<p>The study of cities is a vital part of a liberal arts curriculum. During this moment of global change, such forms of knowledge are of critical importance. The world is more urban now than in any other era in human history, and with this rapid urbanization has come the crucial role of cities as sites of economic development, crucibles of civic citizenship, and spaces of cultural imagination.</p>
<p>The Urban Studies major is housed in the Department of City and Regional Planning (DCRP) of the College of Environmental Design. The major seeks to introduce students to the following bodies of knowledge:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Historical and contemporary analysis of American and global urbanization, urbanism, urban societies, and urban political economies</li>
	<li>Conceptual tools, analytical methods, and theoretical frameworks to understand urban environments such as economic analysis, social science theory, and visualization technologies</li>
	<li>Forms, functions, and practices of urban planning and design, metropolitan governance, social movements, and social justice, including issues such as transportation planning, community development, and housing</li>
	<li>Ways of providing more humane, equitable, environmentally sensitive, and efficient settlements as well as ways to lead change for better urban futures</li>
</ol>
<p>The major trains undergraduates for a variety of future careers and fields of graduate study that are related to urban studies and planning. These include practice-oriented fields such as urban planning, law, non-profit management, and public policy as well as research-oriented fields such as geography, sociology, and anthropology. Above all, the intent of the major is to produce urban citizens and global leaders.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Students must declare one of the CED majors at the time of application to the college; however, current UC Berkeley students may apply to change into CED. Transfer applicants must complete two years worth of lower division coursework to be considered for admission to CED. For information regarding admission to the major for freshmen, transfer students, and current students who wish to change majors or colleges, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/colleges-schools/environmental-design/#choosingamajortext">College of Environmental Design (CED) page</a> in this Guide or the <a href="http://ced.berkeley.edu/admissions/undergraduate/">CED website</a>.</p>

<h3>Upper Division Capstone Experience (Required for Students Admitted Fall 2013 and Later)</h3>
<p>During the junior and/or senior year, students admitted to UC Berkeley FL 16 and later are required to complete ONE of the following four capstone experiences. (Students admitted FL13-SP16 must complete TWO capstones.) Courses taken to fulfill the Capstone Experience requirement may be used for the Capstone only and may <strong>not</strong> also be used to fulfill the Upper Division Urban Studies Core Requirement above or the requirement to complete 3 “Upper Division College of Environmental Design Courses Outside of City Planning”:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Thesis:</strong> This option requires <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENV%20DES%20195B" title="ENV DES 195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENV DES 195B');">ENV DES 195B</a></span> (Thesis Research and Writing). Whether a thesis is written or a project is produced, this option should be pursued with a faculty adviser.</li>

	<li><strong>Planning Studio:</strong> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=CY%20PLAN%20116" title="CY PLAN 116" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'CY PLAN 116');">CY PLAN 116</a></span>, an advanced synthetic educational experience.</li>

To merit 3 units, the internship should require approximately 9 hours per week for 15 weeks. If you are thinking about doing an internship in the summer, see the Urban Studies advisor in 250 Wurster Hall for details.</li>

Over half of the world's population is now urban. As urban populations swell, metropolitan areas in both the developed and the developing world struggle to provide basic services and address the negative externalities associated with rapid growth. Sanitation, transportation, pollution, energy services, and public safety typically fall to sub-national governments. Yet local sub-national institutions face difficulties as they tackle these challenges because</span><span class="deschide"> development tends to spill over political boundaries and resources are limited. Such difficulties are particularly acute in the developing world due to tighter resource constraints, weak institutions, and the comparative severity of the underlying problems. Moreover, democratization and decentralization suggest that urban governance and service delivery may have become more democratic, but present challenges with respect to priority setting, coordination, and corruption.</span><br/>
