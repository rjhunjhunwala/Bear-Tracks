<p>Students who earn a Bachelor of Science degree from the Haas School of Business Undergraduate Program possess the knowledge and technical skills necessary to understand the modern business world, to achieve the highest levels of success in their professional careers, and to prepare for subsequent graduate work. Coursework is fully integrated with the University's liberal arts curriculum, resulting in graduates who are able to draw upon their knowledge of the arts and sciences as well as business in their endeavors.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>The highly competitive Haas Undergraduate Program offers a BS in Business Administration. Students interested in applying can choose one of the following pathways:</p>
<p><strong>Global Management Program (GMP)</strong><br/>
The selective Global Management Program blends rigorous business and general education with broad cultural understanding, preparing students to lead in financial services, communications, social sector solutions, foreign affairs, management consulting, and more.</p>
<p>Study in the four-year program begins in the summer with orientation and courses at UC Berkeley and includes the Berkeley Global Edge experience as a mandatory component—completed in fall of freshman year.</p>
<p>The program is only open to freshmen during the UC application period. </p>
<p>For further information, please see the <a href="http://haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/gmp.html">GMP web site</a></p>
<p><strong>Management, Entrepreneurship &amp; Technology (M.E.T.)</strong></p>
<p>The selective Management, Entrepreneurship, &amp; Technology program at the <a href="http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/">Haas School of </a>Business and the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/">College of Engineering</a> at Berkeley is a fully integrated, two-degree program. In four years, students earn a full Bachelor of Science degree in Business from Berkeley Haas and choice of a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Sciences (EECS), Industrial Engineering &amp; Operations Research (IEOR), Mechanical Engineering (ME), Bioengineering (BioE), or Civil Engineering (CE) from Berkeley Engineering.</p>
<p>The program is only open to freshmen during the UC application period. </p>
<p>For further information, please see the <a href="http://met.berkeley.edu/">M.E.T. website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer and Continuing UC Berkeley</strong></p>
<p>The Haas Undergraduate Program accepts applicants from both <a href="http://haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/transfer_admissions.html">transfer</a> and continuing <a href="http://haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/ucb_admissions.html">UC Berkeley students</a>. Before applying to the major, visit the <a href="http://haas.berkeley.edu/undergrad" target="_blank">website</a> which contains complete information concerning academic qualifications for admission with details about prerequisites and degree requirements.

<h3>Graduate in 3 or 3.5 Years</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For students considering graduating in less than four years, it's important to acknowledge the reasons to undertake such a plan of study. While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation. All things considered, please see the tables for three and three and a half year degree options.</span></p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Guided by the missions of the undergraduate program, and the University's mission of teaching, research, and service, the mission of the Haas School of Business is to develop leaders who redefine how we do business.</p>
<p>The Haas School of Business Undergraduate Program has developed student learning goals for the Business major that provide faculty and students with a shared understanding of the purpose of the major as well as what graduating seniors are expected to know or to be able to do at the end of their course of study as it relates to the school’s mission.</p>
<p>The learning goals are assessed to determine whether students are achieving the outcomes. The assessment results are used to inform curricular design and other program offerings. All steps require input and participation from the business school community, particularly the faculty. The resulting learning goals, which have their origin in the core curriculum, were shaped over several months by faculty and administration and are listed below.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Students will be skilled in critical thinking and decision making, as supported by the appropriate use of analytical and quantitative techniques.</li>
	<li>Students will apply functional area concepts and theories appropriately.</li>
	<li>Students will be effective communicators who can prepare and deliver oral and written presentations using appropriate technologies.</li>
	<li>Students will be sensitive to the ethical requirements of business activities.</li>
	<li>Students will tackle strategic and organizational challenges with innovative solutions.</li>
</ol>

The course is designed to cover advanced corporate finance issues. Its purpose is two-fold. First, it will help students develop a tool-box, both conceptual and quantitative, to address real-world corporate financial issues that they will likely use immediately in any finance-related career. Second, the course is designed to give the “the big picture,” i.e., sharpen understanding of how corporate financial</span><span class="deschide"> strategy helps increase a firm’s value in a dynamic environment. The course examines qualitative factors that help determine financial strategy, including the costs of financial distress and the value of financial flexibility, as well as quantitative techniques, such as option pricing, that will be helpful in various analyses.</span><br/>

Consumer behavior is the study of how consumers process information, form attitudes and judgments, and make decisions. Its study is critical to understand how consumers think and behave, which is critical for a company wishing to develop a customer focus.

Consumer psychology</span><span class="deschide"> is the systematic study of how consumers perceive information, how they encode it in memory, integrate it with other sources of information, retrieve it from memory, and utilize it to make decisions.

This course—a mixture of lectures, readings, business cases and corporate speakers—uses theory, frameworks, tools and business cases to teach students how to systematically evaluate and implement sustainability strategies that also maintain or maximize financial returns. Students are taught to identify opportunities to create business value from environmental and social challenges, and to evaluate</span><span class="deschide"> the competitive implications related to sustainability initiatives. What type of long-term strategies can organizations set to simultaneously foster sustainable development strategy and sound financial practice? How should decision makers make trade-offs between these two organizational objectives? When is “sustainability” also “good business”?</span><br/>

Energy is one of the main drivers of civilization. Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use. Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed</span><span class="deschide"> world. On the other hand, we must completely overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution. Are these shifts truly within our reach? Can we achieve both simultaneously? If so, how? This Big Ideas course will grapple with these questions using an interdisciplinary systems approach.</span><br/>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For students considering graduating in less than four years, it's important to acknowledge the reasons to undertake such a plan of study. While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation. All things considered, please see the tables for three and three and a half year degree options.</span></p>

<p>Guided by the missions of the undergraduate program, and the University's mission of teaching, research, and service, the mission of the Haas School of Business is to develop leaders who redefine how we do business.</p>
<p>The Haas School of Business Undergraduate Program has developed student learning goals for the Business major that provide faculty and students with a shared understanding of the purpose of the major as well as what graduating seniors are expected to know or to be able to do at the end of their course of study as it relates to the school’s mission.</p>
<p>The learning goals are assessed to determine whether students are achieving the outcomes. The assessment results are used to inform curricular design and other program offerings. All steps require input and participation from the business school community, particularly the faculty. The resulting learning goals, which have their origin in the core curriculum, were shaped over several months by faculty and administration and are listed below.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Students will be skilled in critical thinking and decision making, as supported by the appropriate use of analytical and quantitative techniques.</li>
	<li>Students will apply functional area concepts and theories appropriately.</li>
	<li>Students will be effective communicators who can prepare and deliver oral and written presentations using appropriate technologies.</li>
	<li>Students will be sensitive to the ethical requirements of business activities.</li>
	<li>Students will tackle strategic and organizational challenges with innovative solutions.</li>
</ol>

The course is designed to cover advanced corporate finance issues. Its purpose is two-fold. First, it will help students develop a tool-box, both conceptual and quantitative, to address real-world corporate financial issues that they will likely use immediately in any finance-related career. Second, the course is designed to give the “the big picture,” i.e., sharpen understanding of how corporate financial</span><span class="deschide"> strategy helps increase a firm’s value in a dynamic environment. The course examines qualitative factors that help determine financial strategy, including the costs of financial distress and the value of financial flexibility, as well as quantitative techniques, such as option pricing, that will be helpful in various analyses.</span><br/>

Consumer psychology</span><span class="deschide"> is the systematic study of how consumers perceive information, how they encode it in memory, integrate it with other sources of information, retrieve it from memory, and utilize it to make decisions.

This is a project-based course in collaborative innovation where students experience group creativity and team-based design by using techniques from across the disciplines of business, theater, design, and art practice. Students will leverage problem framing and solving techniques derived from critical thinking, systems thinking, and creative problem solving (popularly known today as design thinking). The course is grounded</span><span class="deschide"> in a brief weekly lecture that sets out the theoretical, historical, and cultural contexts for particular innovation practices, but the majority of the class involves hands-on studio-based learning guided by an interdisciplinary team of teachers leading small group collaborative projects.</span><br/>

This course covers the methods and applications of impact evaluations, which is the science of measuring the causal impact of a program or policy on outcomes of interest. At its essence, impact evaluation is about generating evidence on which policies work, and which don’t. This subject matter should appeal to three main audiences: (1) those in decision-making positions, such as policy makers and business leaders, and</span><span class="deschide"> need to consume the information generated from impact evaluations to make informed evidence-based decisions, (2) project managers, development practitioners and business managers who commission impact evaluations and (3) researchers who actually design and implement impact evaluations.</span><br/>

Energy is one of the main drivers of civilization. Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use. Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed</span><span class="deschide"> world. On the other hand, we must completely overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution. Are these shifts truly within our reach? Can we achieve both simultaneously? If so, how? This Big Ideas course will grapple with these questions using an interdisciplinary systems approach.</span><br/>

<p>Students who earn a Bachelor of Science degree from the Haas School of Business Undergraduate Program possess the knowledge and technical skills necessary to understand the modern business world, to achieve the highest levels of success in their professional careers, and to prepare for subsequent graduate work. Coursework is fully integrated with the University's liberal arts curriculum, resulting in graduates who are able to draw upon their knowledge of the arts and sciences as well as business in their endeavors.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>The highly competitive Haas Undergraduate Program offers a BS in Business Administration. Students interested in applying can choose one of the following pathways:</p>
<p><strong>Global Management Program (GMP)</strong><br/>
The selective Global Management Program blends rigorous business and general education with broad cultural understanding, preparing students to lead in financial services, communications, social sector solutions, foreign affairs, management consulting, and more.</p>
<p>Study in the four-year program begins in the summer with orientation and courses at UC Berkeley and includes the Berkeley Global Edge experience as a mandatory component—completed in fall of freshman year.</p>
<p>The program is only open to freshmen during the UC application period. </p>

Before applying to the major, visit the <a href="http://haas.berkeley.edu/undergrad" target="_blank">website</a> which contains complete information concerning academic qualifications for admission with details about prerequisites and degree requirements.

<h3>Campus Requirement</h3>
<p>The following campus requirements are prerequisites for admission to the undergraduate business major.</p>
<p><a href="/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-cultures-requirement/">American Cultures</a></p>
<p>American Cultures (AC) is the one requirement that all undergraduate students at UC Berkeley need to take and pass in order to graduate.

<h3>Graduate in 3 or 3.5 Years</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For students considering graduating in less than four years, it's important to acknowledge the reasons to undertake such a plan of study. While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation. All things considered, please see the tables for three and three and a half year degree options.</span></p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Guided by the missions of the undergraduate program, and the University's mission of teaching, research, and service, the mission of the Haas School of Business is to develop leaders who redefine how we do business.</p>
<p>The Haas School of Business Undergraduate Program has developed student learning goals for the Business major that provide faculty and students with a shared understanding of the purpose of the major as well as what graduating seniors are expected to know or to be able to do at the end of their course of study as it relates to the school’s mission.</p>
<p>The learning goals are assessed to determine whether students are achieving the outcomes. The assessment results are used to inform curricular design and other program offerings. All steps require input and participation from the business school community, particularly the faculty. The resulting learning goals, which have their origin in the core curriculum, were shaped over several months by faculty and administration and are listed below.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Students will be skilled in critical thinking and decision making, as supported by the appropriate use of analytical and quantitative techniques.</li>
	<li>Students will apply functional area concepts and theories appropriately.</li>
	<li>Students will be effective communicators who can prepare and deliver oral and written presentations using appropriate technologies.</li>
	<li>Students will be sensitive to the ethical requirements of business activities.</li>
	<li>Students will tackle strategic and organizational challenges with innovative solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a visual representation of the relationship between the core curriculum and the expected outcomes, please see the <a href="http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/learninggoals.html" target="_blank">Haas School of Business website</a>.</p>

The course is designed to cover advanced corporate finance issues. Its purpose is two-fold. First, it will help students develop a tool-box, both conceptual and quantitative, to address real-world corporate financial issues that they will likely use immediately in any finance-related career. Second, the course is designed to give the “the big picture,” i.e., sharpen understanding of how corporate financial</span><span class="deschide"> strategy helps increase a firm’s value in a dynamic environment. The course examines qualitative factors that help determine financial strategy, including the costs of financial distress and the value of financial flexibility, as well as quantitative techniques, such as option pricing, that will be helpful in various analyses.</span><br/>

Consumer psychology</span><span class="deschide"> is the systematic study of how consumers perceive information, how they encode it in memory, integrate it with other sources of information, retrieve it from memory, and utilize it to make decisions.

This course provides a survey of innovative social movements and their complex relationships to social media technologies.

The course will place into</span><span class="deschide"> comparative relief the discourses of explicitly racially- or ethnically-defined movements and movements that mobilize based on other, sometimes overlapping categories of marginalization including class, immigration status, gender identity and occupational category.</span><br/>

This course covers the methods and applications of impact evaluations, which is the science of measuring the causal impact of a program or policy on outcomes of interest. At its essence, impact evaluation is about generating evidence on which policies work, and which don’t. This subject matter should appeal to three main audiences: (1) those in decision-making positions, such as policy makers and business leaders, and</span><span class="deschide"> need to consume the information generated from impact evaluations to make informed evidence-based decisions, (2) project managers, development practitioners and business managers who commission impact evaluations and (3) researchers who actually design and implement impact evaluations.</span><br/>

This course—a mixture of lectures, readings, business cases and corporate speakers—uses theory, frameworks, tools and business cases to teach students how to systematically evaluate and implement sustainability strategies that also maintain or maximize financial returns. Students are taught to identify opportunities to create business value from environmental and social challenges, and to evaluate</span><span class="deschide"> the competitive implications related to sustainability initiatives. What type of long-term strategies can organizations set to simultaneously foster sustainable development strategy and sound financial practice?

Energy is one of the main drivers of civilization. Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use. Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed</span><span class="deschide"> world. On the other hand, we must completely overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution. Are these shifts truly within our reach? Can we achieve both simultaneously? If so, how? This Big Ideas course will grapple with these questions using an interdisciplinary systems approach.</span><br/>

Do you have an idea for a new business, but want to learn how to more fully develop this idea? Would you like to receive funding for your business idea, but lack a framework to ask for capital?

Through the planning process that tightly links market and financial planning a business plan creates a set of standards to which investors and teammates can evaluate actual performance, laying the foundation for an “operating plan” once the business is launched.</span><br/>

<p>Students who earn a Bachelor of Science degree from the Haas School of Business Undergraduate Program possess the knowledge and technical skills necessary to understand the modern business world, to achieve the highest levels of success in their professional careers, and to prepare for subsequent graduate work. Coursework is fully integrated with the University's liberal arts curriculum, resulting in graduates who are able to draw upon their knowledge of the arts and sciences as well as business in their endeavors.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>The highly competitive Haas Undergraduate Program offers a BS in Business Administration. Students interested in applying can choose one of the following pathways:</p>
<p><strong>Global Management Program (GMP)</strong><br/>
The selective Global Management Program blends rigorous business and general education with broad cultural understanding, preparing students to lead in financial services, communications, social sector solutions, foreign affairs, management consulting, and more.</p>
<p>Study in the four-year program begins in the summer with orientation and courses at UC Berkeley and includes the Berkeley Global Edge experience as a mandatory component—completed in fall of freshman year.</p>
<p>The program is only open to freshmen during the UC application period. </p>
<p>For further information, please see the <a href="http://haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/gmp.html">GMP web site</a></p>
<p><strong>Management, Entrepreneurship &amp; Technology (M.E.T.)</strong></p>
<p>The selective Management, Entrepreneurship, &amp; Technology program at the <a href="http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/">Haas School of </a>Business and the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/">College of Engineering</a> at Berkeley is a fully integrated, two-degree program. In four years, students earn a full Bachelor of Science degree in Business from Berkeley Haas and choice of a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Sciences (EECS), Industrial Engineering &amp; Operations Research (IEOR), Mechanical Engineering (ME), Bioengineering (BioE), or Civil Engineering (CE) from Berkeley Engineering.</p>
<p>The program is only open to freshmen during the UC application period. </p>

<h3>Campus Requirement</h3>
<p>The following campus requirements are prerequisites for admission to the undergraduate business major.</p>
<p><a href="/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-cultures-requirement/">American Cultures</a></p>
<p>American Cultures (AC) is the one requirement that all undergraduate students at UC Berkeley need to take and pass in order to graduate.

<h3>Graduate in 3 or 3.5 Years</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For students considering graduating in less than four years, it's important to acknowledge the reasons to undertake such a plan of study. While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation. All things considered, please see the tables for three and three and a half year degree options.</span></p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Guided by the missions of the undergraduate program, and the University's mission of teaching, research, and service, the mission of the Haas School of Business is to develop leaders who redefine how we do business.</p>
<p>The Haas School of Business Undergraduate Program has developed student learning goals for the Business major that provide faculty and students with a shared understanding of the purpose of the major as well as what graduating seniors are expected to know or to be able to do at the end of their course of study as it relates to the school’s mission.</p>
<p>The learning goals are assessed to determine whether students are achieving the outcomes. The assessment results are used to inform curricular design and other program offerings. All steps require input and participation from the business school community, particularly the faculty. The resulting learning goals, which have their origin in the core curriculum, were shaped over several months by faculty and administration and are listed below.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Students will be skilled in critical thinking and decision making, as supported by the appropriate use of analytical and quantitative techniques.</li>
	<li>Students will apply functional area concepts and theories appropriately.</li>
	<li>Students will be effective communicators who can prepare and deliver oral and written presentations using appropriate technologies.</li>
	<li>Students will be sensitive to the ethical requirements of business activities.</li>
	<li>Students will tackle strategic and organizational challenges with innovative solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a visual representation of the relationship between the core curriculum and the expected outcomes, please see the <a href="http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/learninggoals.html" target="_blank">Haas School of Business website</a>.</p>

First, it will help students develop a tool-box, both conceptual and quantitative, to address real-world corporate financial issues that they will likely use immediately in any finance-related career. Second, the course is designed to give the “the big picture,” i.e., sharpen understanding of how corporate financial</span><span class="deschide"> strategy helps increase a firm’s value in a dynamic environment. The course examines qualitative factors that help determine financial strategy, including the costs of financial distress and the value of financial flexibility, as well as quantitative techniques, such as option pricing, that will be helpful in various analyses.</span><br/>

Consumer behavior is the study of how consumers process information, form attitudes and judgments, and make decisions. Its study is critical to understand how consumers think and behave, which is critical for a company wishing to develop a customer focus. Given how different people are, it is amazing how similarly their minds work. Consumer psychology</span><span class="deschide"> is the systematic study of how consumers perceive information, how they encode it in memory, integrate it with other sources of information, retrieve it from memory, and utilize it to make decisions. It is one of the building blocks of the study of marketing and provides the student with a set of tools with diverse applications.</span><br/>

Energy is one of the main drivers of civilization. Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use. Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed</span><span class="deschide"> world. On the other hand, we must completely overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution. Are these shifts truly within our reach? Can we achieve both simultaneously? If so, how? This Big Ideas course will grapple with these questions using an interdisciplinary systems approach.</span><br/>

<p>Students who earn a Bachelor of Science degree from the Haas School of Business Undergraduate Program possess the knowledge and technical skills necessary to understand the modern business world, to achieve the highest levels of success in their professional careers, and to prepare for subsequent graduate work. Coursework is fully integrated with the University's liberal arts curriculum, resulting in graduates who are able to draw upon their knowledge of the arts and sciences as well as business in their endeavors.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>The highly competitive Haas Undergraduate Program offers a BS in Business Administration. Students interested in applying can choose one of the following pathways:</p>
<p><strong>Global Management Program (GMP)</strong><br/>
The selective Global Management Program blends rigorous business and general education with broad cultural understanding, preparing students to lead in financial services, communications, social sector solutions, foreign affairs, management consulting, and more.</p>
<p>Study in the four-year program begins in the summer with orientation and courses at UC Berkeley and includes the Berkeley Global Edge experience as a mandatory component—completed in fall of freshman year.</p>
<p>The program is only open to freshmen during the UC application period. </p>
<p>For further information, please see the <a href="http://haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/gmp.html">GMP web site</a></p>
<p><strong>Management, Entrepreneurship &amp; Technology (M.E.T.)</strong></p>
<p>The selective Management, Entrepreneurship, &amp; Technology program at the <a href="http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/">Haas School of </a>Business and the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/">College of Engineering</a> at Berkeley is a fully integrated, two-degree program. In four years, students earn a full Bachelor of Science degree in Business from Berkeley Haas and choice of a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Sciences (EECS), Industrial Engineering &amp; Operations Research (IEOR), Mechanical Engineering (ME), Bioengineering (BioE), or Civil Engineering (CE) from Berkeley Engineering.</p>
<p>The program is only open to freshmen during the UC application period. </p>
<p>For further information, please see the <a href="http://met.berkeley.edu/">M.E.T. website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer and Continuing UC Berkeley</strong></p>
<p>The Haas Undergraduate Program accepts applicants from both <a href="http://haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/transfer_admissions.html">transfer</a> and continuing <a href="http://haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/ucb_admissions.html">UC Berkeley students</a>. Before applying to the major, visit the <a href="http://haas.berkeley.edu/undergrad" target="_blank">website</a> which contains complete information concerning academic qualifications for admission with details about prerequisites and degree requirements.

<h3>Graduate in 3 or 3.5 Years</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For students considering graduating in less than four years, it's important to acknowledge the reasons to undertake such a plan of study. While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation. All things considered, please see the tables for three and three and a half year degree options.</span></p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Guided by the missions of the undergraduate program, and the University's mission of teaching, research, and service, the mission of the Haas School of Business is to develop leaders who redefine how we do business.</p>
<p>The Haas School of Business Undergraduate Program has developed student learning goals for the Business major that provide faculty and students with a shared understanding of the purpose of the major as well as what graduating seniors are expected to know or to be able to do at the end of their course of study as it relates to the school’s mission.</p>
<p>The learning goals are assessed to determine whether students are achieving the outcomes. The assessment results are used to inform curricular design and other program offerings. All steps require input and participation from the business school community, particularly the faculty. The resulting learning goals, which have their origin in the core curriculum, were shaped over several months by faculty and administration and are listed below.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Students will be skilled in critical thinking and decision making, as supported by the appropriate use of analytical and quantitative techniques.</li>
	<li>Students will apply functional area concepts and theories appropriately.</li>
	<li>Students will be effective communicators who can prepare and deliver oral and written presentations using appropriate technologies.</li>
	<li>Students will be sensitive to the ethical requirements of business activities.</li>
	<li>Students will tackle strategic and organizational challenges with innovative solutions.</li>
</ol>

The course is designed to cover advanced corporate finance issues. Its purpose is two-fold. First, it will help students develop a tool-box, both conceptual and quantitative, to address real-world corporate financial issues that they will likely use immediately in any finance-related career. Second, the course is designed to give the “the big picture,” i.e., sharpen understanding of how corporate financial</span><span class="deschide"> strategy helps increase a firm’s value in a dynamic environment. The course examines qualitative factors that help determine financial strategy, including the costs of financial distress and the value of financial flexibility, as well as quantitative techniques, such as option pricing, that will be helpful in various analyses.</span><br/>

Consumer behavior is the study of how consumers process information, form attitudes and judgments, and make decisions. Its study is critical to understand how consumers think and behave, which is critical for a company wishing to develop a customer focus.

Consumer psychology</span><span class="deschide"> is the systematic study of how consumers perceive information, how they encode it in memory, integrate it with other sources of information, retrieve it from memory, and utilize it to make decisions.

This course—a mixture of lectures, readings, business cases and corporate speakers—uses theory, frameworks, tools and business cases to teach students how to systematically evaluate and implement sustainability strategies that also maintain or maximize financial returns. Students are taught to identify opportunities to create business value from environmental and social challenges, and to evaluate</span><span class="deschide"> the competitive implications related to sustainability initiatives. What type of long-term strategies can organizations set to simultaneously foster sustainable development strategy and sound financial practice? How should decision makers make trade-offs between these two organizational objectives? When is “sustainability” also “good business”?</span><br/>

Energy is one of the main drivers of civilization. Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use. Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed</span><span class="deschide"> world. On the other hand, we must completely overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution. Are these shifts truly within our reach? Can we achieve both simultaneously? If so, how? This Big Ideas course will grapple with these questions using an interdisciplinary systems approach.</span><br/>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For students considering graduating in less than four years, it's important to acknowledge the reasons to undertake such a plan of study. While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation. All things considered, please see the tables for three and three and a half year degree options.</span></p>

<p>Guided by the missions of the undergraduate program, and the University's mission of teaching, research, and service, the mission of the Haas School of Business is to develop leaders who redefine how we do business.</p>
<p>The Haas School of Business Undergraduate Program has developed student learning goals for the Business major that provide faculty and students with a shared understanding of the purpose of the major as well as what graduating seniors are expected to know or to be able to do at the end of their course of study as it relates to the school’s mission.</p>
<p>The learning goals are assessed to determine whether students are achieving the outcomes. The assessment results are used to inform curricular design and other program offerings. All steps require input and participation from the business school community, particularly the faculty. The resulting learning goals, which have their origin in the core curriculum, were shaped over several months by faculty and administration and are listed below.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Students will be skilled in critical thinking and decision making, as supported by the appropriate use of analytical and quantitative techniques.</li>
	<li>Students will apply functional area concepts and theories appropriately.</li>
	<li>Students will be effective communicators who can prepare and deliver oral and written presentations using appropriate technologies.</li>
	<li>Students will be sensitive to the ethical requirements of business activities.</li>
	<li>Students will tackle strategic and organizational challenges with innovative solutions.</li>
</ol>

The course is designed to cover advanced corporate finance issues. Its purpose is two-fold. First, it will help students develop a tool-box, both conceptual and quantitative, to address real-world corporate financial issues that they will likely use immediately in any finance-related career. Second, the course is designed to give the “the big picture,” i.e., sharpen understanding of how corporate financial</span><span class="deschide"> strategy helps increase a firm’s value in a dynamic environment. The course examines qualitative factors that help determine financial strategy, including the costs of financial distress and the value of financial flexibility, as well as quantitative techniques, such as option pricing, that will be helpful in various analyses.</span><br/>

Consumer psychology</span><span class="deschide"> is the systematic study of how consumers perceive information, how they encode it in memory, integrate it with other sources of information, retrieve it from memory, and utilize it to make decisions.

This is a project-based course in collaborative innovation where students experience group creativity and team-based design by using techniques from across the disciplines of business, theater, design, and art practice. Students will leverage problem framing and solving techniques derived from critical thinking, systems thinking, and creative problem solving (popularly known today as design thinking). The course is grounded</span><span class="deschide"> in a brief weekly lecture that sets out the theoretical, historical, and cultural contexts for particular innovation practices, but the majority of the class involves hands-on studio-based learning guided by an interdisciplinary team of teachers leading small group collaborative projects.</span><br/>

This course covers the methods and applications of impact evaluations, which is the science of measuring the causal impact of a program or policy on outcomes of interest. At its essence, impact evaluation is about generating evidence on which policies work, and which don’t. This subject matter should appeal to three main audiences: (1) those in decision-making positions, such as policy makers and business leaders, and</span><span class="deschide"> need to consume the information generated from impact evaluations to make informed evidence-based decisions, (2) project managers, development practitioners and business managers who commission impact evaluations and (3) researchers who actually design and implement impact evaluations.</span><br/>

Energy is one of the main drivers of civilization. Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use. Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed</span><span class="deschide"> world. On the other hand, we must completely overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution. Are these shifts truly within our reach? Can we achieve both simultaneously? If so, how? This Big Ideas course will grapple with these questions using an interdisciplinary systems approach.</span><br/>
