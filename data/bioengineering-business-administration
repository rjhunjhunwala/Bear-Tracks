<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/entry-level-writing-requirement/">Entry Level Writing</a></p>
<p>All students who enter the University of California as freshmen must demonstrate their command of the English language by fulfilling the Entry Level Writing Requirement. Fulfillment of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all reading and composition courses at UC Berkeley. </p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-history-institutions-requirement/">American History and American Institutions</a></p>
<p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a US resident who graduates from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Campus Requirement</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-cultures-requirement/">American Cultures</a></p>
<p>American Cultures (AC) is the one requirement that all undergraduate students at UC Berkeley need to take and pass in order to graduate. The requirement offers an exciting intellectual environment centered on the study of race, ethnicity, and culture of the United States. AC courses offer students opportunities to be part of research-led, highly accomplished teaching environments, grappling with the complexity of American culture.</p>
<h4><strong>M.E.T. Program Requirements</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Reading and Composition</strong></p>
<p>Two Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) courses must be taken for a letter grade (C- or better required), and must be completed by no later than the end of the sophomore year (4th semester of enrollment). The first half of R&amp;C, the “A” course, must be completed by the end of the freshman year; the second half of R&amp;C, the “B “course, by no later than the end of the sophomore year or a student's registration will be blocked. View a <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/reading-composition-requirement/">detailed list of courses </a>that fulfill Reading and Composition requirements. </p>
<p><strong>Breadth Requirement</strong></p>
<p>The undergraduate breadth requirement provides Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program. As the foundation of a liberal arts education, breadth courses give students a view into the intellectual life of the University while introducing them to a multitude of perspectives and approaches to research and scholarship. Engaging students in new disciplines and with peers from other majors, the breadth experience strengthens interdisciplinary connections and context that prepare Berkeley graduates to understand and solve the complex issues of their day.</p>
<p>Students in the M.E.T. Program must successfully complete six breadth courses, one in each of the following categories:</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Arts and Literature</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Historical Studies</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">International Studies</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Philosophy and Values (will be satisfied with UGBA 107)</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Physical Science (will be satisfied with Physics 7B)</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Social and Behavioral Sciences (will be satisfied with Econ 1)</p>
<ul>
	<li>With the exception of UGBA 107, UGBA courses cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>With the exception of Econ 1, microeconomics and macroeconomics at any level (Econ 2, Econ 3, Econ 100A/B, Econ 101A/B, IAS 106/107) cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses offered by any Engineering department, with the exception of BIO ENG 100, COMPSCI C79, ENGIN 125, 157AC, 185, MEC ENG 191K and 191AC, cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>No more than two courses from any one department may be used to satisfy the breadth requirement (<a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">L&amp;S Discovery courses</a> are exempt).</li>
	<li>Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate exams cannot be used to fulfill the breadth requirement. Some A-Level exams are accepted, but a maximum of two A-Level exams may be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
	<li>Two of the breadth courses must be upper-division (courses numbered 100-196).</li>
	<li>Courses numbered 97, 98, 99, or above 196 may not be used to complete any breadth requirement.</li>
	<li>Breadth courses must be a minimum of 3 semester units.</li>
	<li>Reading &amp; Composition courses cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class Schedule Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Minimum units per semester: 13</li>
	<li>Maximum units per semester:  20.5</li>
	<li>Students in the M.E.T. Program must enroll each semester in no fewer than two technical courses (of a minimum of 3 units each) required of the engineering major program of study in which the student is officially declared.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minimum Academic (Grade) Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>A minimum overall and semester grade point average of 2.000 (C average) is required. Students will be subject to dismissal from the University if during any fall or spring semester their overall U.C. GPA falls below a 2.000, or their semester GPA is less than 2.000. </li>
	<li>Students must achieve a minimum GPA of 2.000 (C average) in upper division technical courses each semester. Students will be subject to dismissal from the University if their upper division technical GPA falls below 2.000. </li>
	<li>A minimum overall GPA of 2.000, and a minimum 2.000 GPA in upper division technical course work required of the major are required to graduate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unit Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>A minimum of 120 units are required to graduate.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) will count towards the 120 units; a maximum of four are allowed in a given semester.</li>
	<li>A maximum of four units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-6a107e05-7fff-22c5-9386-924a0b5064b3">Passed grades may account for no more than one third of the total units completed at UC Berkeley, Fall Program for Freshmen (FPF), UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), or UC Berkeley Washington Program (UCDC) toward the 120 overall minimum unit requirement. Transfer credit is not factored into the limit. This includes transfer units from outside of the UC system, other UC campuses, credit-bearing exams, as well as UC Berkeley Extension XB units.</span></li>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> Students should understand the architecture and design principles of modern biomedical sensor data-acquisition (sensor-DAQ) systems. They should understand how to choose the appropriate biomedical sensor, instrumentation amplifier, number of bits, sampling rate, anti-aliasing filter, and DAQ system. They will learn how to design a low-noise instrumentation amplifier circuit. They should understand the crucial importance of suppressing 60 Hz and other interferences to acquire high quality low-level biomedical signals. They should understand the design principles of building, debugging.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will achieve knowledge and skills in biomedical signal acquisition. They will be assessed in their success with the Course Objectives through tests, homeworks, and laboratories. In particular, the tests will ensure that the students have absorbed the theoretical concepts. The laboratories will provide assessment of learning practical skills (e.g., building an ECG circuit).<br/></p></div>

The transport of mass, momentum, and energy are critical to the function of living systems and the design of medical devices. Biological transport phenomena are present at a wide range of length scales: molecular, cellular, organ (whole and by functional unit), and organism. This course develops and applies scaling laws and the methods of continuum mechanics to biological transport phenomena over a range of length and time scales. The course</span><span class="deschide"> is intended for undergraduate students who have taken a course in differential equations and an introductory course in physics.

A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> <br/>
Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
<br/>
•<br/>
Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
•<br/>
Understanding of the origin of surface forces and interfacial free energy, and how they contribute to the development of the biomaterial interface and ultimately biomaterial performance.<br/></p></div>

First, it will help students develop a tool-box, both conceptual and quantitative, to address real-world corporate financial issues that they will likely use immediately in any finance-related career. Second, the course is designed to give the “the big picture,” i.e., sharpen understanding of how corporate financial</span><span class="deschide"> strategy helps increase a firm’s value in a dynamic environment. The course examines qualitative factors that help determine financial strategy, including the costs of financial distress and the value of financial flexibility, as well as quantitative techniques, such as option pricing, that will be helpful in various analyses.</span><br/>

Focusing mainly on two well studied microbiological model systems--the chemotaxis network and Lambda bacteriophage infection--the class systematically introduces key concepts and techniques for biological network deduction, modelling</span><span class="deschide">, analysis, evolution, and synthetic network design. Students analyze the impact of approaches from the quantitative sciences--such as deterministic modelling, stochastic processes, statistics, non-linear dynamics, control theory, information theory, graph theory, etc.--on understanding biological processes, including (stochastic) gene regulation, signalling, network evolution, and synthetic network design. The course aims to identify unsolved problems and discusses possible novel approaches while encouraging students to develop ideas to explore new directions in their own research.</span><br/>

Consumer behavior is the study of how consumers process information, form attitudes and judgments, and make decisions.

Consumer psychology</span><span class="deschide"> is the systematic study of how consumers perceive information, how they encode it in memory, integrate it with other sources of information, retrieve it from memory, and utilize it to make decisions.

Students are taught to identify opportunities to create business value from environmental and social challenges, and to evaluate</span><span class="deschide"> the competitive implications related to sustainability initiatives. What type of long-term strategies can organizations set to simultaneously foster sustainable development strategy and sound financial practice? How should decision makers make trade-offs between these two organizational objectives? When is “sustainability” also “good business”?</span><br/>

Energy is one of the main drivers of civilization. Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use. Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed</span><span class="deschide"> world. On the other hand, we must completely overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution. Are these shifts truly within our reach? Can we achieve both simultaneously? If so, how? This Big Ideas course will grapple with these questions using an interdisciplinary systems approach.</span><br/>

Do you have an idea for a new business, but want to learn how to more fully develop this idea? Would you like to receive funding for your business idea, but lack a framework to ask for capital?

A well-written business plan sets key milestones and indicates the resources needed to achieve them</span><span class="deschide">, in an increasingly complex business environment. Through the planning process that tightly links market and financial planning a business plan creates a set of standards to which investors and teammates can evaluate actual performance, laying the foundation for an “operating plan” once the business is launched.</span><br/>
