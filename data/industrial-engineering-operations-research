				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) is designed to prepare students for technical careers in production or service industries. It provides a strong foundation for those headed for engineering management positions or for those intending to go on to specialized graduate study in operations research, industrial engineering, or business administration.</p>
<p>Students interested in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research may also be interested in the Operations Research and Management Science major in the College of Letters &amp; Science. For further information on this program, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/operations-research-management-science/">Operations Research and Management Science page</a> in this Guide.</p>
<h3>Course of Study Overview</h3>
<p>The core of the program includes basic science, mathematics including probability and statistics, engineering optimization, and stochastic models. This forms the methodological foundation for upper division IEOR electives involving the analysis and design of production and service systems, information systems, and human work systems and organization, among others.</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>This program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of <a href="http://www.abet.org/" target="_blank">ABET</a>.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the College. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html" target="_blank">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few, if any, spaces that open in the College each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a change of college to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college" target="_blank">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor in IEOR. Students must have a minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the minor's prerequisite courses in order to be considered for departmental acceptance into the minor.</p>
<p>For the minor to be added to the transcript, students must file the Confirmation of Completion of Minor form with the Office of Undergraduate Advising in 4145 Etcheverry Hall during the last semester in which they complete their last class for the minor.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To be considered for the minor, students must have a declared major other than IEOR or<br/>
	ORMS and submit the Minor Petition in IEOR.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Submit the Petition form (to the IEOR Student Services Office) when you have at least<br/>
	four (4) of the minor requirements completed. Minor petitions are accepted year-round<br/>
	on a rolling basis.<br/>
	○ A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0<br/>
	in the prerequisite courses is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Students must have completed all course requirements.<br/>
	● All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.<br/>
	● A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill<br/>
	the minor requirements.<br/>
	● No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill<br/>
	requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.<br/>
	● Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Students taking the minor are also required to submit the IEOR Minor Completion Form<br/>
	when they are enrolled in their last required course, by the last day of instruction of their<br/>
	final term.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement. These courses focus upon how the diversity of America's constituent cultural traditions have shaped and continue to shape American identity and experience.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Visit the </span><a href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a> or the <a href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/">American Cultures website</a> for the specific American Cultures courses offered each semester. For a complete list of approved American Cultures courses at UC Berkeley and California Community Colleges, please see the <a href="https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/amcult">American Cultures Subcommittee’s website</a>.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) is designed to prepare students for technical careers in production or service industries. It provides a strong foundation for those headed for engineering management positions or for those intending to go on to specialized graduate study in operations research, industrial engineering, or business administration.</p>
<p>Students interested in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research may also be interested in the Operations Research and Management Science major in the College of Letters &amp; Science. For further information on this program, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/operations-research-management-science/">Operations Research and Management Science page</a> in this Guide.</p>
<h3>Course of Study Overview</h3>
<p>The core of the program includes basic science, mathematics including probability and statistics, engineering optimization, and stochastic models. This forms the methodological foundation for upper division IEOR electives involving the analysis and design of production and service systems, information systems, and human work systems and organization, among others.</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>This program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of <a href="http://www.abet.org/" target="_blank">ABET</a>.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the College. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html" target="_blank">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few, if any, spaces that open in the College each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a change of college to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college" target="_blank">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor in IEOR. Students must have a minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the minor's prerequisite courses in order to be considered for departmental acceptance into the minor.</p>
<p>For the minor to be added to the transcript, students must file the Confirmation of Completion of Minor form with the Office of Undergraduate Advising in 4145 Etcheverry Hall during the last semester in which they complete their last class for the minor.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To be considered for the minor, students must have a declared major other than IEOR or<br/>
	ORMS and submit the Minor Petition in IEOR.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Submit the Petition form (to the IEOR Student Services Office) when you have at least<br/>
	four (4) of the minor requirements completed. Minor petitions are accepted year-round<br/>
	on a rolling basis.<br/>
	○ A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0<br/>
	in the prerequisite courses is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Students must have completed all course requirements.<br/>
	● All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.<br/>
	● A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill<br/>
	the minor requirements.<br/>
	● No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill<br/>
	requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.<br/>
	● Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Students taking the minor are also required to submit the IEOR Minor Completion Form<br/>
	when they are enrolled in their last required course, by the last day of instruction of their<br/>
	final term.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) is designed to prepare students for technical careers in production or service industries. It provides a strong foundation for those headed for engineering management positions or for those intending to go on to specialized graduate study in operations research, industrial engineering, or business administration.</p>
<p>Students interested in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research may also be interested in the Operations Research and Management Science major in the College of Letters &amp; Science. For further information on this program, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/operations-research-management-science/">Operations Research and Management Science page</a> in this Guide.</p>
<h3>Course of Study Overview</h3>
<p>The core of the program includes basic science, mathematics including probability and statistics, engineering optimization, and stochastic models. This forms the methodological foundation for upper division IEOR electives involving the analysis and design of production and service systems, information systems, and human work systems and organization, among others.</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>This program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of <a href="http://www.abet.org/" target="_blank">ABET</a>.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the College. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html" target="_blank">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few, if any, spaces that open in the College each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a change of college to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college" target="_blank">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor in IEOR. Students must have a minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the minor's prerequisite courses in order to be considered for departmental acceptance into the minor.</p>
<p>For the minor to be added to the transcript, students must file the Confirmation of Completion of Minor form with the Office of Undergraduate Advising in 4145 Etcheverry Hall during the last semester in which they complete their last class for the minor.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To be considered for the minor, students must have a declared major other than IEOR or<br/>
	ORMS and submit the Minor Petition in IEOR.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Submit the Petition form (to the IEOR Student Services Office) when you have at least<br/>
	four (4) of the minor requirements completed. Minor petitions are accepted year-round<br/>
	on a rolling basis.<br/>
	○ A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0<br/>
	in the prerequisite courses is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Students must have completed all course requirements.<br/>
	● All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.<br/>
	● A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill<br/>
	the minor requirements.<br/>
	● No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill<br/>
	requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.<br/>
	● Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Students taking the minor are also required to submit the IEOR Minor Completion Form<br/>
	when they are enrolled in their last required course, by the last day of instruction of their<br/>
	final term.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

This is an introductory course in stochastic models. It builds upon a basic course in probability theory and extends the concept of a single random variable into collections of random variables known as stochastic processes. The course focuses on discrete-time Markov chains, Poisson process, continuous-time Markov chains, and renewal theory. It also discusses applications to queueing</span><span class="deschide"> theory, risk analysis and reliability theory. Along with the theory, the course covers stochastic simulation techniques that will allow students to go beyond the models and applications discussed in the course.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) is designed to prepare students for technical careers in production or service industries. It provides a strong foundation for those headed for engineering management positions or for those intending to go on to specialized graduate study in operations research, industrial engineering, or business administration.</p>
<p>Students interested in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research may also be interested in the Operations Research and Management Science major in the College of Letters &amp; Science. For further information on this program, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/operations-research-management-science/">Operations Research and Management Science page</a> in this Guide.</p>
<h3>Course of Study Overview</h3>
<p>The core of the program includes basic science, mathematics including probability and statistics, engineering optimization, and stochastic models. This forms the methodological foundation for upper division IEOR electives involving the analysis and design of production and service systems, information systems, and human work systems and organization, among others.</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>This program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of <a href="http://www.abet.org/" target="_blank">ABET</a>.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the College. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html" target="_blank">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few, if any, spaces that open in the College each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a change of college to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college" target="_blank">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor in IEOR. Students must have a minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the minor's prerequisite courses in order to be considered for departmental acceptance into the minor.</p>
<p>For the minor to be added to the transcript, students must file the Confirmation of Completion of Minor form with the Office of Undergraduate Advising in 4145 Etcheverry Hall during the last semester in which they complete their last class for the minor.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To be considered for the minor, students must have a declared major other than IEOR or<br/>
	ORMS and submit the Minor Petition in IEOR.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Submit the Petition form (to the IEOR Student Services Office) when you have at least<br/>
	four (4) of the minor requirements completed. Minor petitions are accepted year-round<br/>
	on a rolling basis.<br/>
	○ A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0<br/>
	in the prerequisite courses is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Students must have completed all course requirements.<br/>
	● All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.<br/>
	● A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill<br/>
	the minor requirements.<br/>
	● No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill<br/>
	requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.<br/>
	● Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Students taking the minor are also required to submit the IEOR Minor Completion Form<br/>
	when they are enrolled in their last required course, by the last day of instruction of their<br/>
	final term.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement. These courses focus upon how the diversity of America's constituent cultural traditions have shaped and continue to shape American identity and experience.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Visit the </span><a href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a> or the <a href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/">American Cultures website</a> for the specific American Cultures courses offered each semester. For a complete list of approved American Cultures courses at UC Berkeley and California Community Colleges, please see the <a href="https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/amcult">American Cultures Subcommittee’s website</a>.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) is designed to prepare students for technical careers in production or service industries. It provides a strong foundation for those headed for engineering management positions or for those intending to go on to specialized graduate study in operations research, industrial engineering, or business administration.</p>
<p>Students interested in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research may also be interested in the Operations Research and Management Science major in the College of Letters &amp; Science. For further information on this program, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/operations-research-management-science/">Operations Research and Management Science page</a> in this Guide.</p>
<h3>Course of Study Overview</h3>
<p>The core of the program includes basic science, mathematics including probability and statistics, engineering optimization, and stochastic models. This forms the methodological foundation for upper division IEOR electives involving the analysis and design of production and service systems, information systems, and human work systems and organization, among others.</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>This program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of <a href="http://www.abet.org/" target="_blank">ABET</a>.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the College. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html" target="_blank">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is highly unlikely and very competitive as there are few, if any, spaces that open in the College each year to students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a change of college to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college" target="_blank">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor in IEOR. Students must have a minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the minor's prerequisite courses in order to be considered for departmental acceptance into the minor.</p>
<p>For the minor to be added to the transcript, students must file the Confirmation of Completion of Minor form with the Office of Undergraduate Advising in 4145 Etcheverry Hall during the last semester in which they complete their last class for the minor.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To be considered for the minor, students must have a declared major other than IEOR or<br/>
	ORMS and submit the Minor Petition in IEOR.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Submit the Petition form (to the IEOR Student Services Office) when you have at least<br/>
	four (4) of the minor requirements completed. Minor petitions are accepted year-round<br/>
	on a rolling basis.<br/>
	○ A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a minimum GPA of 3.0<br/>
	in the prerequisite courses is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Students must have completed all course requirements.<br/>
	● All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.<br/>
	● A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill<br/>
	the minor requirements.<br/>
	● No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill<br/>
	requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.<br/>
	● Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Students taking the minor are also required to submit the IEOR Minor Completion Form<br/>
	when they are enrolled in their last required course, by the last day of instruction of their<br/>
	final term.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
