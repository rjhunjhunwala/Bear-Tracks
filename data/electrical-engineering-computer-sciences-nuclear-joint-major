				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. These curricula include the core courses in each of the major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. </p>
<p>The electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS)/nuclear engineering (NE) joint major combines the traditional electrical engineering (EE) program with one in the nuclear sciences. Nuclear engineering shares with electrical engineering a concern for electrical power generation, automatic control, computer sciences, and plasmas.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Joint Major</h3>
<p>Admission directly to a joint major is closed to freshmen and junior transfer applicants. Students interested in a joint program may apply to change majors during specific times in their academic progress. Please see the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors">College of Engineering joint majors website</a> for complete details.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

				<a name="fiveyearbsmstext"></a><h2>Five-Year BS/MS</h2><p>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well. It is not intended for students who have definitely decided to pursue a PhD immediately following graduation. Those students are advised to apply for a PhD program at Berkeley or elsewhere during their senior year. Students who have been accepted into the five-year BA/MS or BS/MS are free to change their minds later and apply to enter the PhD program or apply to a PhD program at another university. Note that admission is competitive with all our PhD applicants.</p>
<p>The program is focused on interdisciplinary training at a graduate level; with at least 8 units of course work outside EECS required. Students will emerge as leaders in their technical and professional fields.</p>

You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement.

<h3>Nuclear Engineering</h3>
<h5>MISSION</h5>
<p>The mission of the Department of Nuclear Engineering is to maintain and strengthen the University of California's only center of excellence in nuclear engineering education and research and to serve California and the nation by improving and applying nuclear science and technology. The mission of the undergraduate degree program in Nuclear Engineering is to prepare our students to begin a lifetime of technical achievement and professional leadership in academia, government, the national laboratories, and industry.</p>
<h5>LEARNING GOALS</h5>
<p>The foundation of the UC Berkeley Nuclear Engineering (NE) program is a set of five key objectives for educating undergraduate students. The NE program continuously reviews these objectives internally to ensure that they meet the current needs of the students, and each spring the Program Advisory Committee meets to review the program and recommend changes to better serve students. The NE Program Advisory Committee was established in 1988 and is composed of senior leaders from industry, the national laboratories, and academia.</p>
<p>Nuclear engineering at UC Berkeley prepares undergraduate students for employment or advanced studies with four primary constituencies: industry, the national laboratories, state and federal agencies, and academia (graduate research programs). Graduate research programs are the dominant constituency. From 2000 to 2005, sixty-eight percent of graduating NE seniors indicated plans to attend graduate school in their senior exit surveys. To meet the needs of these constituencies, the objectives of the NE undergraduate program are to produce graduates who as practicing engineers and researchers do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Apply solid knowledge of the fundamental mathematics and natural (both physical and biological) sciences that provide the foundation for engineering applications.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate an understanding of nuclear processes, and the application of general natural science and engineering principles to the analysis and design of nuclear and related systems of current and/or future importance to society.</li>
	<li>Exhibit strong, independent learning, analytical and problem-solving skills, with special emphasis on design, communication, and an ability to work in teams.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate an understanding of the broad social, ethical, safety, and environmental context within which nuclear engineering is practiced.</li>
	<li>Value and practice life-long learning.</li>
</ol>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis</span><span class="deschide">, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br/>

Radiobiology is concerned with the action of ionizing radiation on biological tissues and living organisms. It combines two disciplines: radiation physics and biology. Radiobiology combines our understanding of ionizing radiation and molecular biology, and is a required knowledge for health physicists, radiation biologists and medical physicists. This course will provide such knowledge for a diverse group of students with need in either disciplines. This</span><span class="deschide"> course represents one of the requisites for the Joint UC Berkeley-UC San Francisco Medical Physics Certificate Program.</span><br/>

The project should give students strong foundation to tackle more advanced risk models or dynamic cancer models. <br/>They will be exposed to the multi-scale complexity of the tissue response to ionizing radiation from the whole organism to individual cells and down to the DNA. Molecular biology describing the cellular response and the DNA repair mechanisms will be covered, with an emphasis on cell kinetics such as recovery processes and cell cycle sensitivity. The overall tissue response will also be discussed with an effort to distinguish acute and delayed effects. Radiation risk models and their impact on limits will be introduced and described in the context of past and current research.<br/>This course is designed for Nuclear Engineering students and in particular those pursuing a Medical Physics Certificate with knowledge essential to radiobiology. Students will learn about the history of radiation effects, epidemiology of radiation and evidence of cancer in populations.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> By the end of the class, students should:<br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. These curricula include the core courses in each of the major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. </p>
<p>The electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS)/nuclear engineering (NE) joint major combines the traditional electrical engineering (EE) program with one in the nuclear sciences. Nuclear engineering shares with electrical engineering a concern for electrical power generation, automatic control, computer sciences, and plasmas.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Joint Major</h3>
<p>Admission directly to a joint major is closed to freshmen and junior transfer applicants. Students interested in a joint program may apply to change majors during specific times in their academic progress. Please see the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors">College of Engineering joint majors website</a> for complete details.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

				<a name="fiveyearbsmstext"></a><h2>Five-Year BS/MS</h2><p>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well. It is not intended for students who have definitely decided to pursue a PhD immediately following graduation. Those students are advised to apply for a PhD program at Berkeley or elsewhere during their senior year. Students who have been accepted into the five-year BA/MS or BS/MS are free to change their minds later and apply to enter the PhD program or apply to a PhD program at another university. Note that admission is competitive with all our PhD applicants.</p>
<p>The program is focused on interdisciplinary training at a graduate level; with at least 8 units of course work outside EECS required. Students will emerge as leaders in their technical and professional fields.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Focused on interdisciplinary study and more experience in aligned technical fields such as physics, materials science, statistics, biology, etc., and/or professional disciplines such as management of technology, business, law and public policy.</li>
	<li>If admitted to the program, students must begin the graduate portion in the semester immediately following the conferral of the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only one additional year (two semesters) is permitted beyond the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only available to Berkeley EECS and L&amp;S CS undergraduates.</li>
	<li>Participants in program may serve as graduate student instructors with approval from their faculty research adviser and the 5th Year MS Committee.</li>
	<li>Participants in program are self-funded.</li>

<h3>Nuclear Engineering</h3>
<h5>MISSION</h5>
<p>The mission of the Department of Nuclear Engineering is to maintain and strengthen the University of California's only center of excellence in nuclear engineering education and research and to serve California and the nation by improving and applying nuclear science and technology. The mission of the undergraduate degree program in Nuclear Engineering is to prepare our students to begin a lifetime of technical achievement and professional leadership in academia, government, the national laboratories, and industry.</p>
<h5>LEARNING GOALS</h5>
<p>The foundation of the UC Berkeley Nuclear Engineering (NE) program is a set of five key objectives for educating undergraduate students. The NE program continuously reviews these objectives internally to ensure that they meet the current needs of the students, and each spring the Program Advisory Committee meets to review the program and recommend changes to better serve students. The NE Program Advisory Committee was established in 1988 and is composed of senior leaders from industry, the national laboratories, and academia.</p>
<p>Nuclear engineering at UC Berkeley prepares undergraduate students for employment or advanced studies with four primary constituencies: industry, the national laboratories, state and federal agencies, and academia (graduate research programs). Graduate research programs are the dominant constituency. From 2000 to 2005, sixty-eight percent of graduating NE seniors indicated plans to attend graduate school in their senior exit surveys. To meet the needs of these constituencies, the objectives of the NE undergraduate program are to produce graduates who as practicing engineers and researchers do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Apply solid knowledge of the fundamental mathematics and natural (both physical and biological) sciences that provide the foundation for engineering applications.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate an understanding of nuclear processes, and the application of general natural science and engineering principles to the analysis and design of nuclear and related systems of current and/or future importance to society.</li>
	<li>Exhibit strong, independent learning, analytical and problem-solving skills, with special emphasis on design, communication, and an ability to work in teams.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate an understanding of the broad social, ethical, safety, and environmental context within which nuclear engineering is practiced.</li>
	<li>Value and practice life-long learning.</li>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis</span><span class="deschide">, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br/>

This course is intended for graduate students interested in acquiring a foundation in nuclear fuel cycle with topics ranging from nuclear-fuel reprocessing to waste treatment and final disposal. The emphasis is on the relationship between nuclear-power utilization and its environmental impacts. The goal is for graduate engineering students to gain sufficient understanding in how nuclear-power utilization affects the environment, so that they</span><span class="deschide"> are better prepared to design an advanced system that would result in minimized environmental impact. The lectures will consist of two parts. The first half includes mathematical models for individual processes in a fuel cycle, such as nuclear fuel reprocessing, waste solidification, repository performance, and nuclear transmutation in a nuclear reactor. In the second half, these individual models are integrated, which enables students to evaluate environmental impact of a fuel cycle.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. These curricula include the core courses in each of the major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. </p>
<p>The electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS)/nuclear engineering (NE) joint major combines the traditional electrical engineering (EE) program with one in the nuclear sciences. Nuclear engineering shares with electrical engineering a concern for electrical power generation, automatic control, computer sciences, and plasmas.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Joint Major</h3>
<p>Admission directly to a joint major is closed to freshmen and junior transfer applicants. Students interested in a joint program may apply to change majors during specific times in their academic progress. Please see the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors">College of Engineering joint majors website</a> for complete details.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

				<a name="fiveyearbsmstext"></a><h2>Five-Year BS/MS</h2><p>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well. It is not intended for students who have definitely decided to pursue a PhD immediately following graduation. Those students are advised to apply for a PhD program at Berkeley or elsewhere during their senior year. Students who have been accepted into the five-year BA/MS or BS/MS are free to change their minds later and apply to enter the PhD program or apply to a PhD program at another university. Note that admission is competitive with all our PhD applicants.</p>
<p>The program is focused on interdisciplinary training at a graduate level; with at least 8 units of course work outside EECS required. Students will emerge as leaders in their technical and professional fields.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Focused on interdisciplinary study and more experience in aligned technical fields such as physics, materials science, statistics, biology, etc., and/or professional disciplines such as management of technology, business, law and public policy.</li>
	<li>If admitted to the program, students must begin the graduate portion in the semester immediately following the conferral of the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only one additional year (two semesters) is permitted beyond the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only available to Berkeley EECS and L&amp;S CS undergraduates.</li>
	<li>Participants in program may serve as graduate student instructors with approval from their faculty research adviser and the 5th Year MS Committee.</li>
	<li>Participants in program are self-funded.</li>

<h3>Nuclear Engineering</h3>
<h5>MISSION</h5>
<p>The mission of the Department of Nuclear Engineering is to maintain and strengthen the University of California's only center of excellence in nuclear engineering education and research and to serve California and the nation by improving and applying nuclear science and technology. The mission of the undergraduate degree program in Nuclear Engineering is to prepare our students to begin a lifetime of technical achievement and professional leadership in academia, government, the national laboratories, and industry.</p>
<h5>LEARNING GOALS</h5>
<p>The foundation of the UC Berkeley Nuclear Engineering (NE) program is a set of five key objectives for educating undergraduate students. The NE program continuously reviews these objectives internally to ensure that they meet the current needs of the students, and each spring the Program Advisory Committee meets to review the program and recommend changes to better serve students. The NE Program Advisory Committee was established in 1988 and is composed of senior leaders from industry, the national laboratories, and academia.</p>
<p>Nuclear engineering at UC Berkeley prepares undergraduate students for employment or advanced studies with four primary constituencies: industry, the national laboratories, state and federal agencies, and academia (graduate research programs). Graduate research programs are the dominant constituency. From 2000 to 2005, sixty-eight percent of graduating NE seniors indicated plans to attend graduate school in their senior exit surveys. To meet the needs of these constituencies, the objectives of the NE undergraduate program are to produce graduates who as practicing engineers and researchers do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Apply solid knowledge of the fundamental mathematics and natural (both physical and biological) sciences that provide the foundation for engineering applications.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate an understanding of nuclear processes, and the application of general natural science and engineering principles to the analysis and design of nuclear and related systems of current and/or future importance to society.</li>
	<li>Exhibit strong, independent learning, analytical and problem-solving skills, with special emphasis on design, communication, and an ability to work in teams.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate an understanding of the broad social, ethical, safety, and environmental context within which nuclear engineering is practiced.</li>
	<li>Value and practice life-long learning.</li>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis</span><span class="deschide">, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br/>

This course is intended for graduate students interested in acquiring a foundation in nuclear fuel cycle with topics ranging from nuclear-fuel reprocessing to waste treatment and final disposal. The emphasis is on the relationship between nuclear-power utilization and its environmental impacts. The goal is for graduate engineering students to gain sufficient understanding in how nuclear-power utilization affects the environment, so that they</span><span class="deschide"> are better prepared to design an advanced system that would result in minimized environmental impact. The lectures will consist of two parts. The first half includes mathematical models for individual processes in a fuel cycle, such as nuclear fuel reprocessing, waste solidification, repository performance, and nuclear transmutation in a nuclear reactor. In the second half, these individual models are integrated, which enables students to evaluate environmental impact of a fuel cycle.</span><br/>

Radiobiology is concerned with the action of ionizing radiation on biological tissues and living organisms. It combines two disciplines: radiation physics and biology. Radiobiology combines our understanding of ionizing radiation and molecular biology, and is a required knowledge for health physicists, radiation biologists and medical physicists. This course will provide such knowledge for a diverse group of students with need in either disciplines. This</span><span class="deschide"> course represents one of the requisites for the Joint UC Berkeley-UC San Francisco Medical Physics Certificate Program.</span><br/>

The project should give students strong foundation to tackle more advanced risk models or dynamic cancer models. <br/>They will be exposed to the multi-scale complexity of the tissue response to ionizing radiation from the whole organism to individual cells and down to the DNA. Molecular biology describing the cellular response and the DNA repair mechanisms will be covered, with an emphasis on cell kinetics such as recovery processes and cell cycle sensitivity. The overall tissue response will also be discussed with an effort to distinguish acute and delayed effects. Radiation risk models and their impact on limits will be introduced and described in the context of past and current research.<br/>This course is designed for Nuclear Engineering students and in particular those pursuing a Medical Physics Certificate with knowledge essential to radiobiology. Students will learn about the history of radiation effects, epidemiology of radiation and evidence of cancer in populations.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> By the end of the class, students should:<br/>
-<br/>
Be proficient in the main mechanisms describing the interaction of ionizing radiation with tissue;<br/>
-<br/>
Be able to know the existing gaps in this field and where more research is needed;<br/>
-<br/>
Understand how radiation affects DNA and leads to gene mutation<br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. These curricula include the core courses in each of the major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. </p>
<p>The electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS)/nuclear engineering (NE) joint major combines the traditional electrical engineering (EE) program with one in the nuclear sciences. Nuclear engineering shares with electrical engineering a concern for electrical power generation, automatic control, computer sciences, and plasmas.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Joint Major</h3>
<p>Admission directly to a joint major is closed to freshmen and junior transfer applicants. Students interested in a joint program may apply to change majors during specific times in their academic progress. Please see the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors">College of Engineering joint majors website</a> for complete details.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

				<a name="fiveyearbsmstext"></a><h2>Five-Year BS/MS</h2><p>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well. It is not intended for students who have definitely decided to pursue a PhD immediately following graduation. Those students are advised to apply for a PhD program at Berkeley or elsewhere during their senior year. Students who have been accepted into the five-year BA/MS or BS/MS are free to change their minds later and apply to enter the PhD program or apply to a PhD program at another university. Note that admission is competitive with all our PhD applicants.</p>
<p>The program is focused on interdisciplinary training at a graduate level; with at least 8 units of course work outside EECS required. Students will emerge as leaders in their technical and professional fields.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Focused on interdisciplinary study and more experience in aligned technical fields such as physics, materials science, statistics, biology, etc., and/or professional disciplines such as management of technology, business, law and public policy.</li>
	<li>If admitted to the program, students must begin the graduate portion in the semester immediately following the conferral of the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only one additional year (two semesters) is permitted beyond the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only available to Berkeley EECS and L&amp;S CS undergraduates.</li>
	<li>Participants in program may serve as graduate student instructors with approval from their faculty research adviser and the 5th Year MS Committee.</li>
	<li>Participants in program are self-funded.</li>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement.

<h3>Nuclear Engineering</h3>
<h5>MISSION</h5>
<p>The mission of the Department of Nuclear Engineering is to maintain and strengthen the University of California's only center of excellence in nuclear engineering education and research and to serve California and the nation by improving and applying nuclear science and technology. The mission of the undergraduate degree program in Nuclear Engineering is to prepare our students to begin a lifetime of technical achievement and professional leadership in academia, government, the national laboratories, and industry.</p>
<h5>LEARNING GOALS</h5>
<p>The foundation of the UC Berkeley Nuclear Engineering (NE) program is a set of five key objectives for educating undergraduate students. The NE program continuously reviews these objectives internally to ensure that they meet the current needs of the students, and each spring the Program Advisory Committee meets to review the program and recommend changes to better serve students. The NE Program Advisory Committee was established in 1988 and is composed of senior leaders from industry, the national laboratories, and academia.</p>
<p>Nuclear engineering at UC Berkeley prepares undergraduate students for employment or advanced studies with four primary constituencies: industry, the national laboratories, state and federal agencies, and academia (graduate research programs). Graduate research programs are the dominant constituency. From 2000 to 2005, sixty-eight percent of graduating NE seniors indicated plans to attend graduate school in their senior exit surveys. To meet the needs of these constituencies, the objectives of the NE undergraduate program are to produce graduates who as practicing engineers and researchers do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Apply solid knowledge of the fundamental mathematics and natural (both physical and biological) sciences that provide the foundation for engineering applications.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate an understanding of nuclear processes, and the application of general natural science and engineering principles to the analysis and design of nuclear and related systems of current and/or future importance to society.</li>
	<li>Exhibit strong, independent learning, analytical and problem-solving skills, with special emphasis on design, communication, and an ability to work in teams.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate an understanding of the broad social, ethical, safety, and environmental context within which nuclear engineering is practiced.</li>
	<li>Value and practice life-long learning.</li>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis</span><span class="deschide">, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br/>

This course is intended for graduate students interested in acquiring a foundation in nuclear fuel cycle with topics ranging from nuclear-fuel reprocessing to waste treatment and final disposal. The emphasis is on the relationship between nuclear-power utilization and its environmental impacts. The goal is for graduate engineering students to gain sufficient understanding in how nuclear-power utilization affects the environment, so that they</span><span class="deschide"> are better prepared to design an advanced system that would result in minimized environmental impact. The lectures will consist of two parts. The first half includes mathematical models for individual processes in a fuel cycle, such as nuclear fuel reprocessing, waste solidification, repository performance, and nuclear transmutation in a nuclear reactor. In the second half, these individual models are integrated, which enables students to evaluate environmental impact of a fuel cycle.</span><br/>

The project should give students strong foundation to tackle more advanced risk models or dynamic cancer models. <br/>They will be exposed to the multi-scale complexity of the tissue response to ionizing radiation from the whole organism to individual cells and down to the DNA. Molecular biology describing the cellular response and the DNA repair mechanisms will be covered, with an emphasis on cell kinetics such as recovery processes and cell cycle sensitivity. The overall tissue response will also be discussed with an effort to distinguish acute and delayed effects. Radiation risk models and their impact on limits will be introduced and described in the context of past and current research.<br/>This course is designed for Nuclear Engineering students and in particular those pursuing a Medical Physics Certificate with knowledge essential to radiobiology. Students will learn about the history of radiation effects, epidemiology of radiation and evidence of cancer in populations.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> By the end of the class, students should:<br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. These curricula include the core courses in each of the major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. </p>
<p>The electrical engineering and computer sciences (EECS)/nuclear engineering (NE) joint major combines the traditional electrical engineering (EE) program with one in the nuclear sciences. Nuclear engineering shares with electrical engineering a concern for electrical power generation, automatic control, computer sciences, and plasmas.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Joint Major</h3>
<p>Admission directly to a joint major is closed to freshmen and junior transfer applicants. Students interested in a joint program may apply to change majors during specific times in their academic progress. Please see the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors">College of Engineering joint majors website</a> for complete details.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

				<a name="fiveyearbsmstext"></a><h2>Five-Year BS/MS</h2><p>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well. It is not intended for students who have definitely decided to pursue a PhD immediately following graduation. Those students are advised to apply for a PhD program at Berkeley or elsewhere during their senior year. Students who have been accepted into the five-year BA/MS or BS/MS are free to change their minds later and apply to enter the PhD program or apply to a PhD program at another university. Note that admission is competitive with all our PhD applicants.</p>
<p>The program is focused on interdisciplinary training at a graduate level; with at least 8 units of course work outside EECS required. Students will emerge as leaders in their technical and professional fields.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Focused on interdisciplinary study and more experience in aligned technical fields such as physics, materials science, statistics, biology, etc., and/or professional disciplines such as management of technology, business, law and public policy.</li>
	<li>If admitted to the program, students must begin the graduate portion in the semester immediately following the conferral of the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only one additional year (two semesters) is permitted beyond the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only available to Berkeley EECS and L&amp;S CS undergraduates.</li>
	<li>Participants in program may serve as graduate student instructors with approval from their faculty research adviser and the 5th Year MS Committee.</li>
	<li>Participants in program are self-funded.</li>

<h3>Nuclear Engineering</h3>
<h5>MISSION</h5>
<p>The mission of the Department of Nuclear Engineering is to maintain and strengthen the University of California's only center of excellence in nuclear engineering education and research and to serve California and the nation by improving and applying nuclear science and technology. The mission of the undergraduate degree program in Nuclear Engineering is to prepare our students to begin a lifetime of technical achievement and professional leadership in academia, government, the national laboratories, and industry.</p>
<h5>LEARNING GOALS</h5>
<p>The foundation of the UC Berkeley Nuclear Engineering (NE) program is a set of five key objectives for educating undergraduate students. The NE program continuously reviews these objectives internally to ensure that they meet the current needs of the students, and each spring the Program Advisory Committee meets to review the program and recommend changes to better serve students. The NE Program Advisory Committee was established in 1988 and is composed of senior leaders from industry, the national laboratories, and academia.</p>
<p>Nuclear engineering at UC Berkeley prepares undergraduate students for employment or advanced studies with four primary constituencies: industry, the national laboratories, state and federal agencies, and academia (graduate research programs). Graduate research programs are the dominant constituency. From 2000 to 2005, sixty-eight percent of graduating NE seniors indicated plans to attend graduate school in their senior exit surveys. To meet the needs of these constituencies, the objectives of the NE undergraduate program are to produce graduates who as practicing engineers and researchers do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Apply solid knowledge of the fundamental mathematics and natural (both physical and biological) sciences that provide the foundation for engineering applications.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate an understanding of nuclear processes, and the application of general natural science and engineering principles to the analysis and design of nuclear and related systems of current and/or future importance to society.</li>
	<li>Exhibit strong, independent learning, analytical and problem-solving skills, with special emphasis on design, communication, and an ability to work in teams.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate an understanding of the broad social, ethical, safety, and environmental context within which nuclear engineering is practiced.</li>
	<li>Value and practice life-long learning.</li>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis</span><span class="deschide">, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br/>

This course is intended for graduate students interested in acquiring a foundation in nuclear fuel cycle with topics ranging from nuclear-fuel reprocessing to waste treatment and final disposal. The emphasis is on the relationship between nuclear-power utilization and its environmental impacts. The goal is for graduate engineering students to gain sufficient understanding in how nuclear-power utilization affects the environment, so that they</span><span class="deschide"> are better prepared to design an advanced system that would result in minimized environmental impact. The lectures will consist of two parts. The first half includes mathematical models for individual processes in a fuel cycle, such as nuclear fuel reprocessing, waste solidification, repository performance, and nuclear transmutation in a nuclear reactor. In the second half, these individual models are integrated, which enables students to evaluate environmental impact of a fuel cycle.</span><br/>

Radiobiology is concerned with the action of ionizing radiation on biological tissues and living organisms. It combines two disciplines: radiation physics and biology. Radiobiology combines our understanding of ionizing radiation and molecular biology, and is a required knowledge for health physicists, radiation biologists and medical physicists. This course will provide such knowledge for a diverse group of students with need in either disciplines. This</span><span class="deschide"> course represents one of the requisites for the Joint UC Berkeley-UC San Francisco Medical Physics Certificate Program.</span><br/>

The project should give students strong foundation to tackle more advanced risk models or dynamic cancer models. <br/>They will be exposed to the multi-scale complexity of the tissue response to ionizing radiation from the whole organism to individual cells and down to the DNA. Molecular biology describing the cellular response and the DNA repair mechanisms will be covered, with an emphasis on cell kinetics such as recovery processes and cell cycle sensitivity. The overall tissue response will also be discussed with an effort to distinguish acute and delayed effects. Radiation risk models and their impact on limits will be introduced and described in the context of past and current research.<br/>This course is designed for Nuclear Engineering students and in particular those pursuing a Medical Physics Certificate with knowledge essential to radiobiology. Students will learn about the history of radiation effects, epidemiology of radiation and evidence of cancer in populations.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> By the end of the class, students should:<br/>
