				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Legal Studies is an interdisciplinary, liberal arts major that engages the meanings, values, practices, and institutions of law and legality. The Legal Studies curriculum examines how law shapes and is shaped by political, economic, and cultural forces. The major is designed to stimulate the critical understanding of and inquiry about the theoretical frameworks, historical dynamics, and cultural embeddedness of law.</p>
<p>The Legal Studies faculty and students grapple with important questions of social policy within the framework of significant concerns in jurisprudence and theories of justice. These concerns include individual liberty, privacy, and autonomy; political and social equality; the just distribution of resources and opportunities within society; the relationship between citizens and the state; democratic participation and representation; the moral commitments of the community; and the preservation of human dignity.</p>
<p>The major’s course offerings examine law and legality from both humanist and empirical perspectives. Courses are organized into interdisciplinary topical areas that transcend disciplinary boundaries in the interest of collaborative inquiry.</p>
<p>The Legal Studies major is under the academic supervision of the School of Law faculty.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students may declare the major after completing two of the four prerequisites with a 2.0 grade point average (GPA) between the two courses and an overall UC Berkeley GPA of 2.0. For details regarding the prerequisites, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page. All courses taken for the major must be taken for a letter grade.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>With the consent of the major advisor, a student majoring in Legal Studies with an overall UC Berkeley grade point average (GPA) of 3.5 and a GPA of 3.5 in Legal Studies courses by the end of the spring semester junior year may be admitted to the honors program. The student must have completed at least half of the major requirements before being admitted to the honors program.</p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Legal Studies is an interdisciplinary liberal arts major that engages the meanings, values, practices, and institutions of law and legality. The Legal Studies curriculum examines how law shapes and is shaped by political, economic, and cultural forces. The major is designed to stimulate critical understanding of and inquiry about the theoretical frameworks, historical dynamics, and cultural embeddedness of law.</p>
<p>The Legal Studies faculty and students grapple with important questions of social policy within the framework of significant concerns in jurisprudence and theories of justice. These concerns include individual liberty, privacy, and autonomy; political and social equality; the just distribution of resources and opportunities within society; the relationship between citizens and the state; democratic participation and representation; the moral commitments of the community; and the preservation of human dignity.</p>
<p>The major’s course offerings examine law and legality from both humanist and empirical perspectives. Courses are organized into interdisciplinary topical areas that transcend disciplinary boundaries in the interest of collaborative inquiry.</p>
<h3>Legal Studies’ Pedagogic Objectives</h3>
<p><em>Convey how law relates to social context</em>:  Students will learn about the transformation of legal processes and systems across time and space (e.g., globalization, transnational processes). They will also study how law shapes and is shaped by economic, political, and cultural forces, as well as how and why law in action often differs from legal doctrine.</p>
<p><em>Adopt an explicitly interdisciplinary approach:  </em>Students will focus on pervasive problems of legal and social policy across traditional curricular and disciplinary boundaries. Although the program encompasses multiple disciplinary perspectives (e.g., history, economics, sociology), it is designed to transcend academic identities rather than compartmentalize the study of law into the discrete perspectives of established disciplines. To accomplish this integration, the major is organized around areas of focus that explore common themes but include coursework across disciplinary boundaries.</p>
<p><em>Integrate empirical and humanities-oriented perspectives</em>: Students will be exposed to both empirical and humanities-oriented perspectives on law and legal institutions through distribution requirements within the major. Empirical perspectives encompass public policy analysis, training in the epistemological commitments of social science (e.g., empirical methods, the logic of social inquiry), and familiarity with the central questions and tenets related to law in disciplines such as economics, sociology, and political science. Humanities perspectives include maintaining the program’s historical focus on clarifying fundamental values, examining philosophical questions related to law, and understanding the operation and effects of social and cultural practices as they relate to law, legal institutions, and the phenomenon they regulate. After students fulfill the basic distribution requirements, they may, but will not be required to, concentrate their efforts in either empirical or humanities-oriented perspectives.</p>
<p><em>Promote engagement with social policy</em>: Students will be encouraged to engage deeply with social policy guided by significant themes in jurisprudence and theories of justice. These themes include individual liberty, privacy, democracy, and the relationship between the citizen and the state. Engaging with these themes ensures that policy studies are basic and critical, rather than confined to preexisting policy formulations and assumptions. This new objective of engagement with social policy is intended to connect humanistic inquiries regarding justice, morality, and values, with empirical inquiries into patterns of social behavior and the effects of law on society. This goal will be accomplished through both coursework and field work options.</p>
<p><em>Encourage civic engagement and an appreciation of the values at stake in legal concerns</em>:  Consistent with the mission of a public university, the major will develop informed and engaged citizens with sufficient knowledge and background to participate in civic institutions and the development of law and policy during and after their education at Berkeley. This participation could take many forms, including interacting with public officials, joining the legal profession, working for legal institutions, engaging in policy analysis, advocacy, social movement building, community organizing, political activism, and the like. Civic engagement includes confronting the relationship between law and justice, and understanding how law affects the public interest and social utility.</p>
<p><em>Provide a liberal arts education</em>: The major will continue to have a liberal arts orientation. Students will learn to analyze and understand legal rules and legal institutions, but from a broader perspective than is typically taught in a traditional law school setting.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p><span>The faculty strongly supports an undergraduate liberal arts education that teaches students to develop their intellectual capacities: how to research topics independently, how to ask penetrating questions, how to analyze problems, how to construct arguments based on critical thinking, how to make well-founded judgments, how to identify issues of importance for the future. The intent of the program is that courses be framed with this perspective. In addition, the program is committed to introducing students to multiple disciplinary approaches to the study of law and legal institutions, as well as conveying important basic knowledge about the core features of the American legal system.</span></p>
<h3>Critical Thinking Skills</h3>
<p><em>In concert with the goals identified above, these critical thinking skills focus on particular forms of analysis central to engaging with law and legal institutions from multiple disciplinary perspectives.</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Identify and evaluate arguments, synthesize ideas, and develop well-substantiated, coherent, and concise arguments, whether in oral or written form.</li>
	<li>Identify and follow a logical sequence or argument through to its end; recognize faulty reasoning.</li>
	<li>Develop the ability to critically evaluate proposed legal reforms and policies.</li>
	<li>Develop the ability to formulate generalized, abstract principles in a way that clarifies the major issues at stake and identifies the most relevant elements of a concept or text.</li>
	<li>Promote exploration of the role of law in American society from both social science and humanities perspectives.</li>
	<li>Learn to draw from multiple disciplinary approaches and fields of study across philosophy, history, economics, political science, and sociology; synthesize, bridge, and question disciplinary boundaries to identify new inquiries or insights.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Basic Knowledge about Law and Legal Institutions</h3>
<p><em>These goals address important basic knowledge about law and legal institutions that the program seeks to convey. These goals are not intended to provide a pre-professional education but instead to produce citizens literate in the basic functions and structure of legal systems.</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Understand core theories about the relationship between law and society.</li>
	<li>Be introduced to core features of the American legal system.</li>
	<li>Understand basic legal terminology, legal concepts, legal actors, and modes of legal reasoning.</li>
	<li>Become acquainted with legal systems other than our own, including how they compare to the current American legal system.</li>
	<li>Develop insights into how law has evolved through time, including the temporal and geographical transformation of legal processes and systems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Engaged Citizenship</h3>
<p><em>The faculty believes that our role as a program in a public institution should include training students to be engaged, active, and critical citizens in our society. Many legal studies students engage in civic participation and service while at Berkeley, and many go on to careers in public service. We seek to develop more opportunities for students to develop practical skills and knowledge relevant to those experiences in addition to the broader intellectual skills conveyed by a liberal arts education.</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Experience the law in action through service learning, exposure to legal clinics, problem solving, and social policy engagement.</li>
	<li>Enable civic engagement and participation in developing and critiquing social policy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Research Methods</h3>
<p><em>A key part of a liberal arts education is learning how to conduct independent research and analysis. The program seeks to expose students to a multidisciplinary range of methods of research.  </em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Develop an understanding of methods of research and forms of evidence across multiple disciplines.</li>
	<li>Develop skills necessary to find and to assess relevant jurisprudential, social science, and humanities materials related to law and legal institutions.</li>
	<li>Develop basic abilities in statistical analysis and reasoning.</li>
	<li>Understand the logic of inquiry in the social sciences.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Humanities</h3>
<p>(Defined as philosophy, political theory, and history.)</p>
<p><em> These goals provide general guidance for curricular focus and development in the humanities as they relate to law and legal institutions.</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Encourage understanding of and reflection on fundamental normative concepts such as fairness, due process, equality, and utility.</li>
	<li>Encourage understanding of and reflection on rights, duties, punishment, and justice.</li>
	<li>Encourage understanding of and reflection on the ethical dimensions of the relationship between citizens and the state, and the forms and limits of sovereignty.</li>
	<li>Understand the historical contexts and forces within which legal systems operate and how legal systems influence history and societies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Social Sciences</h3>
<p>(Defined as sociology, political science, psychology and economics.)</p>
<p><em>These goals provide general guidance for curricular focus and development in the social sciences as they relate to law and legal institutions.</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>Develop the ability to connect theory about law and legal institutions with empirical predictions about the state of the world and to evaluate those predictions with data.</li>
	<li>Understand how, and why, the law in action often differs from the law on the books.</li>
	<li>Develop an expansive understanding of the social contexts in which law and legal institutions can be studied empirically.</li>
</ul>

This course explores philosophical themes bearing on the nature of the law and its relationship to morality: e.g., What is law—does its claim rest only on social processes or does law necessarily embody moral claims? Do we have an obligation to obey the law? What are the moral limits of legal punishment? The course will sharpen students’ skills in practical reasoning through the analysis of logical argument. The materials consist of readings from the assigned</span><span class="deschide"> text and additional readings available on bCourses. The format will be a combination of lecture and classroom discussion, with a substantial number of ungraded group debates and simulations.</span><br/>

Law and Economics I is not a prerequisite for Law and Economics II. Students may take either or both courses. Government uses many mechanisms to influence the provision of goods and services. Economists and lawyers have developed a critique of these mechanisms which has prompted substantial reforms in recent years, e.g., deregulation in transportation.

Contemporary moral and political philosophy has been increasingly interested in how conceptions of the self relate to various aspects of our social and political life. These issues have an important bearing on legal theory as well. Law is shaped by certain implicit assumptions about the nature of individuals and collectivities, while it also actively participates in forming the identities of persons and in structuring collective entities such as</span><span class="deschide"> families, corporations, and municipalities. This course will explore some theoretical approaches to this reciprocal relationship between law and the different social actors that it governs.</span><br/>

This course offers a comparative perspective on law and legal institutions. Looking comparatively helps shed light on our own system and question what is “normal” or “natural.” From what it means to be a lawyer to notions of what is “just” or “fair,” courts and dispute resolution outside the U.S. can be both very different and, at times, surprisingly familiar. After an overview of concepts and classic approaches to the study of law and society, the course</span><span class="deschide"> will explore these differences and similarities in three Asian settings: China, Japan, and India. Topics include lawyers, illicit sex, and environmental protection, to see how each country’s history, political structure, values, and interests shape how legal issues are defined and play out</span><br/>

This course advances the claim that the criminal justice system is both a product and a powerful engine of racial hierarchy in American society, and that strategies of restorative justice, which have recently garnered attention in settings from prisons to middle schools, hold out promise as practices of racial justice. We explore this thesis by examining the ways in which criminal justice systems shape the emotions and social relations of victims, offenders</span><span class="deschide">, and members of the larger community.</span><br/>

We will investigate the profound role of law and legal institutions in shaping and defining racial minority and majority communities.

We will concentrate on the impulses – commercial, ideological, and racial – that drove European colonizing; the migrations (voluntary and forced) that sustained it; and the political and legal “technologies” that supplied it with definition, explanation, and institutional capacity. We will pay attention to themes of sovereignty, civic identity, race</span><span class="deschide">, and “manifest destiny” and will discuss how law provided both the language and technical capacity to transform territory into property, people into slaves, and the land’s indigenous inhabitants into “others” who existed “outside” the civic order of the American Republic.</span><br/>

Dimensions of diversity at the heart of this course are perceptions of commonality and attributions of difference defined by race and immigration.
