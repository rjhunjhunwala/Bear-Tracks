				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>ISF is an interdisciplinary major and a research-driven program of liberal education.<strong> </strong>It has been ranked the top personalized major offered at US universities and colleges. ISF offers students the unique opportunity to develop an individualized cross-disciplinary research program that includes a course of study and a senior thesis. The course of study is made up of courses taken in the social sciences, the humanities, and/or the professional schools and colleges, alongside the required courses in ISF.  The capstone experience is a scholarly, rigorously-researched, 40-page required senior thesis, which represents a sustained inquiry in the social sciences or humanities based on original, cross-disciplinary research.</p>
<p>ISF has identified a number of interdisciplinary research fields that have engendered excellent scholarship and attracted students across campus. ISF students may pursue other research fields identified in consultation with ISF faculty and academic advisers. The already-defined ISF research fields provide models and resources about scholarly interests. The research fields found on the ISF website are there to help ISF students identify their own research interests and customize their own research program and course of liberal arts study.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students may apply to the major once per semester. The application deadline is approximately the end of the sixth week of the semester. Students are encouraged to meet with an ISF faculty adviser well in advance of the application deadline date. The application package should consist of a <span>well-conceived research program, including a proposed course of study and an intellectual justification of their proposed study. Research programs must be interdisciplinary, integrating methodological or theoretical approaches from at least three academic disciplines (departments or programs). Interdisciplinary work may be comparative, historical, regional, thematic, or problem-focused. The research program should not replicate an existing major. The purpose of the ISF major is to allow undergraduates to combine work across disciplines in courses and with faculty where no other structured program exists. Finally, the research program must be feasible, and the senior thesis must answer a manageable research question in a semester's hard work (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ISF%20190" title="ISF 190" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ISF 190');">ISF 190</a></span>). Each student's proposed research program is discussed with and approved by a faculty adviser to assure feasibility, but the final responsibility is the student's.</span>
</p>

<p>The nature of the major requires repeated elaboration of the proposed research program, course of study, and senior thesis that best combine students' individual research interests and the ISF program goals. Students are assigned an advisor upon acceptance into the major, although faculty members outside ISF may serve as advisers when appropriate, as approved by the ISF director.</p>
<h3><span>Honors Program</span></h3>
<p class="p1">All honors students enroll in the senior thesis seminar with other majors (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ISF%20190" title="ISF 190" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ISF 190');">ISF 190</a></span>).  Students seeking honors must <span class="s1">identify</span> and seek out senate faculty members from other departments, ideally members of the ISF Faculty Advisory Board, to serve as s<span class="s1">econd readers</span>. Students must then let their ISF 190 instructor know that they intend to pursue honors in the major, and will give the name of their second reader to the ISF 190 instructor. Their grades in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ISF%20190" title="ISF 190" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ISF 190');">ISF 190</a></span> will be constituted by an average of grades assigned by the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ISF%20190" title="ISF 190" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ISF 190');">ISF 190</a></span> Instructor and the second readers.</p>

<p class="p1">Students eligible for honors must have an overall grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.6, including grades in ISF courses, at the beginning of the semester in which they enroll in ISF 190. Students in the honors option will be nominated for a degree of honors (honors, high honors, highest honors) by the ISF instructor, the second reader, or another ladder faculty member. <span>The assessment of the degree of honors will be made by an </span><span class="s1" data-mce-mark="1">ISF Honors Committee</span><span> consisting of no fewer than two teaching faculty of the ISF Program and two </span>academic senate<span> members under the oversight of the ISF director. The ISF Honors Committee will use the criteria of scholarly originality, methodological sophistication (including interdisciplinarity), the quality of source interpretation, and excellence in writing and argumentation to adjudicate the degree of honors to be conferred. To allow adequate time for the Honors Committee to assess and review the senior honors theses, students seeking honors will be required to turn in their final senior theses at the beginning of the Reading/Review/Recitation Week.</span></p>

<p>A Committee of Faculty Advisers will have the discretion, in unusual cases, of accepting applications to the ISF program from students who have completed, with a minimum B- grade, upper division courses that have adequately prepared them for their designated research program and that fulfill the spirit of the prerequisite requirements of disciplinary and regional preparation for the major. Finally, additional courses can be added to each of the two lists as deemed appropriate by the director and the faculty advisory board.</p>
<p>For transfer students, it is strongly recommended that this requirement be completed before enrolling at Berkeley. Transfer students must submit syllabi of courses already taken to their ISF faculty adviser for approval. Both prerequisite courses must be taken for a letter grade. </p>
<p>Note that Academic Senate regulations stipulate that students must have a minimum grade point average of 2.0 before declaring any major in the College of Letters &amp; Science and are required to declare a major by the time they have each completed 60 units.</p>
<h3>Upper Division Requirement: Course of Study</h3>
<p>Select a minimum of 20 upper division units (at least six courses) drawn from at least three fields or disciplines. Upon consent of an adviser, courses outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science may be accepted when relevant, e.g., courses in Social Welfare, Journalism, Public Policy, City Planning, Business Administration, or Architecture. (For further information, please see <a href="http://isf.ugis.berkeley.edu/isf-research-fields" target="_blank">Research Fields</a> on the program's website.) Upon approval from an ISF faculty adviser, a student may include one technical or natural science course as part of their course of study.</p>
<h3>Upper Division Requirement: Core Methodology Courses</h3>
<p>These courses provide an introduction to interdisciplinary theories and methodologies in the social sciences and the humanities.</p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Interdisciplinary Studies Field Major (ISF) is a unique major on campus in that it requires students to engage in a major research project. This enables them not only to engage in qualitative and/or quantitative research but also to organize, synthesize, and communicate—in oral and written form—relevant data and results against the background of evolving theories and key concepts in the social sciences and/or humanities. As student research interests change in relation to larger patterns of social, cultural, and technological transformations, the department carefully monitors existing methodological courses to allow for ongoing flexibility with regard to innovative key concepts and new theoretical tools.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Develop strong interdisciplinary research skills by creating a course of study in the context of which students can explore new phenomena, problems, themes, and issues pertaining to larger social, cultural, technological, and historical transformations.
	<ul>

It’s hard not to open a newspaper or magazine today and see claims being made for artificial intelligence. Advocates argue that software programs will now be able to even perform creative jobs (as opposed to just routine ones) and that this is both a matter of celebration and concern. Critics argue that these claims are hyperbolic, while others argue that they are too close to reality and an indication of how much autonomy we have ceded to machines. In this course</span><span class="deschide">, we will pick apart all of these claims.

We will focus on human behavior in extreme situations: war, life and death conflicts, genocide and mass killing, as well as competing conceptions of human freedom. The course has a distinctive</span><span class="deschide"> dual purpose. On the one hand we want to encourage the learning of critical thinking skills. This includes the ability to systematically evaluate information and competing moral claims. Also, it is intended as an exposure to the interdisciplinary approach. That is, how can different perspectives illuminate the same issue? With this in mind the course draws on important work from philosophy and ethics, social psychology, jurisprudential analysis, historical-political accounts, and personal memoirs.</span><br/>

In this course, we will utilize works in the humanities and the social sciences in order to explore a number of dimensions of self-deception in the modern world. The focus will be upon the willingness to falsify both personal life as well as one's position in the public sphere. The course will begin with an examination of the psychological dimension, emphasizing the importance of the nature of unconscious experience. In this context, we will</span><span class="deschide"> examine how self-awareness is shaped by personal relationships, especially family arrangements. In addition, we will look at the manner in which people often engage in acts of self-deception with regard to the political realm.</span><br/>

This course, required of all ISF majors but open to all students, provides an introduction to the works of foundational social theorists of the nineteenth century, including Karl Marx and Max Weber. Writing in what might be called the “pre disciplinary” period of the modern social sciences, their works cross the boundaries of anthropology, economics, history, political science, sociology, and are today claimed by these</span><span class="deschide"> and other disciplines as essential texts. We will read intensively and critically from their respective works, situating their intellectual contributions in the history of social transformations wrought by industrialization and urbanization, political revolution, and the development of modern consumer society.</span><br/>

Theoretical and methodological tools from the social sciences, jurisprudence, and philosophy will be applied im the analyses of these interplays.</span><span class="deschide"> A study of rights and norms presupposes not only an understanding of the empirical evolution of rights traditions (including constitutional traditions) in a variety of global regions, but also an understanding of the theories of rights and laws that support such traditions as they are embedded in them (just war theories, peace theories, etc.) The study of rights and norms also requires an exploration of the transformations of crucial international norms and rights due to the formation of supranational institutions and organizations in the 20th century (UN, UNESCO, GO's, etc.). The course will provide the students with an opportunity to place emerging transnational rights institutions into a historical and geopolitical framework.</span><br/>

The focus of this course will be on the various ways the nature and trajectory of modern capitalism has been interpreted. Our stress will be on post-Marxist works of analysis. The initial focal point will be on the work of Max Weber and Joseph Schumpeter, as well as important current debates in economic history and social theory generated by their work. Both Weber and Schumpeter display a strong fascination and elaboration with the work of Marx.</span><span class="deschide"> The way they analyze Marx is very revealing about the way contemporary analysts seek to understand the capitalist system. We will also consider a number of current efforts that look at the systemic nature of capitalism. In particular, we are interested in how economic historians now see the development of capitalism. We also want to examine the Weberian tradition in terms of the role of culture in shaping economic behavior. Debates about the nature of globalization will also be considered as well as analysis of the changing nature of work.</span><br/>

In many ways, consumption defines our lives – our identities as consumers are even more important, some would argue, our identities as workers or producers.

What does global commodity chain tell us about colonialization, global inequality, and environmental</span><span class="deschide"> injustice? How can we shape the life cycle of basic commodities—from raw materials to iPhones--in a socially sustainable way?

Development is often defined as a process of economic growth. Only recently there has been a<br/>
growing disagreement about this definition and scholars argue that development should be understood<br/>
as a process of improving human conditions. Health is an important indicator of human development.<br/>
It is still not conclusive whether economic growth automatically translates into better population health<br/>
and whether healthy population</span><span class="deschide"> is a precondition of economic growth because there are other factors<br/>
that affect both health and development. This course will focus on this debate and examine social,<br/>
political, demographic and epidemiologic determinants of health in relation to levels of economic<br/>
development.</span><br/>
