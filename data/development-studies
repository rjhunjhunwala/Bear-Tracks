<p><strong>Note: The Development Studies Major has been retired and folded into Global Studies.  We are no longer accepting Development Studies declarations.  Please visit the</strong> <strong><a href="http://globalstudies.berkeley.edu/">Global Studies website</a></strong> <strong>or the</strong> <strong><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/global-studies/">Global Studies</a></strong> p<strong>age on the Berkeley Academic Guide for more information. </strong></p>
<hr/>
<h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Development Studies (DS) major focuses on social transformation or change. The problems of social transformation are urgent, massive, complex, and often transcend the boundaries of conventional academic disciplines.</p>
<p>DS examines the problems, processes, and prospects for the development of human and material resources in what are generally thought to be the less developed areas of the world. To study comparative development effectively, one must draw upon many disciplines and construct a balanced understanding of historical and contemporary processes. Thus, studying development as a social transformation requires a blending of knowledge and perspectives from political science, economics, sociology, psychology, anthropology, geography, history, and environmental science.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Applications are accepted during the fall and spring semesters from the third week of instruction until the last day of instruction (not the last day of finals). Applications are accepted during the summer from the last week in May until the beginning of the fall semester (not the beginning of classes).</p>
<p>To be eligible to declare, students must not be in the final semester of their undergraduate work. For further information on prerequisites required before declaring the major, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>Additionally, students are encouraged, but not required, to complete two semesters of college-level foreign language or the equivalent before applying to the major.</p>
<p>To get declared you must both:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Attend a Major Declaration Workshop (check the schedule in the IAS office for dates)</li>
	<li>Meet with an IAS adviser to submit the DS application materials</li>
</ul>
<p>Bring a completed DS application to the workshop. Application materials may be submitted after attending the Major Declaration Workshop. However, students will not be officially declared until they have both attended a workshop and submitted all declaration papers.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p><span>To be eligible for honors, students must have senior standing and a GPA of 3.6 in the major and 3.5 in all work completed at UC Berkeley. Doing honors includes a year-long course sequence (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=IAS%20H102" title="IAS H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'IAS H102');">IAS H102</a></span> in the fall and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=DEV%20STD%20H195" title="DEV STD H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'DEV STD H195');">DEV STD H195</a></span> in the spring) in which students learn how to formulate a hypothesis, conduct supporting research, and complete a thesis paper of approximately 75 pages or longer.</span>
</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Development Studies.</p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>Repeat Rule</h3>
<p>Students who earn a grade of F, D-, D, D+ or NP may repeat the course only once. Regardless of the grade the student receives for their second attempt (including F, D-, D or D+), the student may <strong>not</strong> repeat the course a third time.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a <em>Pass/No Pass</em> basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs, with the exception of minors offered outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding residence requirements and unit requirements, please see the College Requirements tab.</p>

<h3>Foreign Language Requirement</h3>
<p class="Default">DS majors must demonstrate proficiency in a modern language other than English by the last semester of their senior year. Proficiency is equivalent to the ability achieved in four college-level semesters (or two years). Language courses taken in high school do not satisfy this requirement. See below for details on how to fulfill the foreign language requirement.</p>
<p class="Default">Languages accepted by the College of Letters &amp; Science are not automatically accepted by the DS major. Please check with a DS adviser for eligible languages.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to fulfill the four-semester language requirement for DS, depending on the individual and his or her background and ability.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) test: </strong>An AP score of 5 or an International Baccalaureate (IB) score of 7 will complete this requirement. An AP score of 4 will place a student into the fourth-semester college level course. A score of 3 will place a student into the third-semester college level course. Documentation of AP scores must be provided.</li>
	<li><strong>Coursework: </strong>Any combination of college courses, summer programs, or college-level study abroad programs can satisfy the language requirement. At a minimum, students must complete the fourth semester (i.e., the second semester of intermediate level) of a language with a grade of C- or better in order to fulfill the requirement. The first, second, and third-level courses may be taken on a <em>Pass/No Pass</em> basis. <span>Language courses need not be taken at UC Berkeley. Courses taken at a community college or any accredited school or university may be acceptable. Transcripts must be submitted and evaluated by a DS adviser. A one-semester upper division course taken abroad in the target language may satisfy the foreign language requirement, depending on the school and program followed. For more information, see a DS adviser concerning language study abroad.</span></li>
	<li><strong>Proficiency exam: </strong>Some, but not all, language departments on campus offer proficiency testing for students with advanced skills in that language. Please note that if a particular language is not taught on the UC Berkeley campus, then students are not able to test in that language. A student would then need to choose one of the other methods for fulfilling the foreign language requirement. Please speak with a DS adviser about proficiency testing.</li>
	<li><strong>High school completion in a non-English language: </strong>Students who were educated in a non-English language through the completion of high school or the equivalent may wish to satisfy this requirement with that experience. This requires a language proficiency exam. </li>
</ol>
