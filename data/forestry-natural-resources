				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p><strong>The Forestry and Natural Resources curriculum is transitioning to <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/ecosystem-management-forestry/">Ecosystem Management and Forestry</a>, effective Fall 2017. Students admitted Fall 2017 or earlier can following the curriculum here,<span class="il"> but new students will be expected to declare Forestry and Natural Resources by the end of their sophomore year (before the end of Spring 2020) to be eligible for the old program</span>.  Incoming students in Fall 2018 will be expected to follow the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/ecosystem-management-forestry/">Ecosystem Management and Forestry</a> requirements.  For updates, please visit the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/majors/forestry-and-natural-resources">major website</a>.</strong></p>
<h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>Forestry and Natural Resources (FNR) focuses on the conservation and restoration of the earth's natural resources through hands-on study of the ecology, stewardship, and management of forest, woodland, and grassland ecosystems. The program offers two concentrations to choose from, and if the student chooses a specialization in Professional Forestry, they can qualify to take the Registered Professional Forester's licensing exam in California.</p>
<p>Students in the FNR major select between two concentrations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Forestry and Natural Sciences concentration is split into two specializations, Professional Forestry and Natural Sciences. The Professional Forestry specialization is accredited by the Society of American Foresters and provides four years of qualifying education or professional experience for licensing as a professional forester in California. The goals of the Professional Forestry specialization are very closely associated with the educational requirements of the forestry profession and prepare our students for careers in forestry or closely related natural resource fields. The Natural Sciences specialization allows students to focus their studies more specifically on ecology and the physical environment</li>
	<li>The Human Dimensions of Natural Resources concentration provides students with greater flexibility to explore subjects in ecology, physical environment, monitoring and measurement, and management and policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students in the program, regardless of concentration, have ample opportunity to acquire interdisciplinary skills in the ecology, stewardship, and management of ecosystems such as forests, woodlands, and grasslands. Within the program, students can choose to emphasize topics such as wildlife biology, water policy, fire science, ecosystem restoration, environmental justice, remote sensing and GIS, and rural sociology.</p>
<p>FNR graduates are well-prepared for graduate school and careers in environmental consulting, public agencies, nonprofit conservation organizations, and private companies. Students also have the option of preparing for professional careers in forestry, wildlife, and range management.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Freshman students may apply directly to the major, or they may select the College of Natural Resource's undeclared option and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. For further information regarding how to declare the major after admission, including information on a change of major or change of college, please see the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook">College of Natural Resources Undergraduate Student Handbook.</a></p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with a GPA of 3.6 or higher may enroll in the College of Natural Resources honors program (H196) once they have reached upper division standing. To fulfill the program requirements, students design, conduct, and report on an individual research project working with a faculty sponsor. For further information about registration for the honors symposium and the honors requirements, please see the <a href="http://nature.berkeley.edu/site/honors_program.php" target="_blank">College of Natural Resources website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>A minor in Forestry is available for students who are interested in learning about forestry and renewable resource management as an adjunct to their chosen fields. Students in many diverse majors such as business administration, integrative biology, and civil engineering may find this minor complementary to their professional career goals. For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the department.</p>

Students must complete a first-level reading and composition course by the end of their second semester and a second-level course by the end of their fourth semester.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/foreign-language-requirement/">Foreign Language</a>: <strong>EEP Majors only</strong></p> <p>The Foreign Language requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. It may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/quantitative-reasoning-requirement/">Quantitative Reasoning</a>: <strong>EEP Majors only</strong></p> <p>The Quantitative Reasoning requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course.</p> <h3>Undergraduate Breadth</h3> <p>Undergraduate breadth provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program and many students complete their breadth courses in their first two years. Breadth courses are built into CNR major requirements and each major requires a different number of breath courses and categories. The EEP major is the only CNR major that requires the entire 7 course breadth. Refer to the major snapshots on each <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/majors-minors" target="_blank">CNR major page</a> for for additional information. </p> <h3>High School Exam Credit</h3> <p>CNR students may apply high school exam credit (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-Level Exam) towards many College and Major Requirements. See <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/courses-grades#AP%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chat" target="_blank">AP Exam Equivalency Chart and Higher Level IB Exam Equivalency Chart</a> in the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">CNR Student Handbook</a> for more information.</p> <h3>Units Requirements</h3> <p>Students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</p> <ul> 	<li>At least 36 units must be upper division courses, including a minimum of 15 units of upper division courses in the College of Natural Resources. </li> 	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) is allowed towards the 120 units; a maximum of four is allowed in a given semester.</li> 	<li>A maximum of 4 units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li> 	<li>Students may receive unit credit for courses graded P (including P/NP units taken through EAP) up to a limit of one-third of the total units taken and passed on the Berkeley campus at the time of graduation.</li> </ul> <h4>Semester Unit Minimum</h4> <p>All CNR students must enroll in at least 13 units each fall and spring semester.</p> <h4>Semester Unit Maximum</h4> <p>To request permission to take more than 19.5 units in a semester, please see the major adviser.</p> <h3>Semester Limit</h3> <p>Students admitted as freshmen must graduate within 8 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students admitted as transfer students must graduate within 4 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students who go on EAP and UCDC can petition for additional semesters. Summer session, UC Extension and non-UC study abroad programs do not count towards this semester limit. Students approved for double majors or  simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester. CNR does not limit the number of total units a student can accrue.</p> <h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3> <p>After the term in which you achieve and exceed 90 units (senior status), you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence at the College of Natural Resources over at least 2 semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units taken while the student is a member of CNR. At least one of the two terms must be a fall or spring semester. Senior residence terms do not need to be completed consecutively. All courses offered on campus for the fall, spring, and summer terms by Berkeley departments and programs and all Berkeley online ('W') courses count. Inter-campus Visitor, Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley Washington Program, and UC Berkeley Extension units do not count toward this requirement.</p> <p>Students may use Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that four units of coursework are completed.</p> <h3>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h3> <p>Participants in a fall, spring or summer UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, or the UC Berkeley Washington Program may meet a modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 of their final 60 semester units in residence (excluding UCEAP). At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after senior status is reached. International travel study programs sponsored by Summer Sessions and education abroad programs offered outside of the UC system do not qualify for modified senior residence.</p> <p>Most students automatically satisfy the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year. In these cases, students should make an appointment to see an adviser to determine how they can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.</p> <h3>Grade Requirements</h3> <ul> 	<li>A 2.0 UC GPA is required for graduation.</li> 	<li>A 2.0 average in all upper division courses required of the major program is required for graduation.</li> 	<li>A grade of at least C- is required in all courses for the major</li> </ul>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Forestry and Natural Resources (FNR) major at the University of California at Berkeley is designed to prepare students to manage forests and wildlands while sustaining ecological integrity and producing vital ecosystem services. The program combines a foundation in the relevant natural and social sciences with explicit hands-on learning opportunities. Students completing this major will be prepared to engage in the challenge of managing forest and natural resources in a rapidly-changing world.</p>
<p>The FNR major includes a professional option (Forestry and Natural Sciences, Professional Forestry specialization) that is accredited by the Society of American Foresters. The Forestry and Natural Resources major also includes a Natural Sciences specialization in the Forestry and Natural Sciences concentration and a Human Dimensions of Natural Resources concentration.</p>
<p>The Professional Forestry specialization provides four years of qualifying education or professional experience for licensing as a professional forester in California. The goals of the Professional Forestry specialization are very closely associated with the educational requirements of the forestry profession and prepare our students for careers in forestry or closely related natural resource fields. When students graduate with a FNR major from UC Berkeley, they will have the basic knowledge and skills to assess and manage forest resources. Graduates with the Professional Forestry specialization should have basic competencies as defined by the Society of American Foresters’ requirements of accredited degree programs. Graduates with the Natural Sciences or Human Dimensions in Natural Resources concentrations will have similar competencies.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>Knowledge and skills for FNR majors are based on the four major subject areas required by the Society of American Foresters. These four subject areas and the basic competencies expected of students areas follows.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ecology and Biology
	<ol>
		<li>Competencies must be documented as an:
		<ul>
			<li>Understanding of taxonomy and ability to identify forest species, their distribution, and associated habitat requirements.</li>
			<li>Understanding of soil properties and processes, hydrology, water quality, and watershed functions.</li>
			<li>Understanding of ecological concepts and principles including the structure and function of ecosystems, plant and animal communities, competition, diversity, population dynamics, succession, disturbance, and nutrient cycling.</li>
			<li>Ability to make ecosystem, forest, and stand assessments.</li>
			<li>Understanding of plant and animal physiology and the effects of climate, fire, pollutants, moisture, nutrients, genetics, insects and diseases on ecosystem health and productivity.</li>
		</ul>
