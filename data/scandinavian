				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Department of Scandinavian offers an undergraduate major with concentrations in five areas: Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Old Norse Studies, and Swedish. Each of these concentrations allows students to explore the major while developing expertise within the language and literature of one of the Nordic languages. While the electives built into each of the five concentrations allow room to explore all phases of Scandinavian literature and cultural history from the medieval to the modern, the core courses for each will emphasize the specific language of choice. Students receive further training in their major language skills by pursuing reading in original Scandinavian languages (when coursework allows) and through special add-on major units (Scandinavian 149). These units allow students the opportunity to work closely with a professor in their major language area. The Old Norse Studies concentration also allows students with strong interests in comparative medieval studies to choose elective courses offered in that field in other departments to complete their course list for the Scandinavian major.</p>
<p>The department is also particularly interested in helping students pursue interdisciplinary interests through its own core courses and through double majors with other fields. Several of the areas in which Scandinavia is of comparative interest or has made a major contribution are as follows: environmental studies, history, drama, medieval literature, folklore, architecture, public policy, linguistics, international studies, peace studies, political science, film, and economics.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>The department encourages all students interested in the undergraduate major in Scandinavian to declare the major as early as possible in their academic careers (even as early as the freshman and sophomore years)  in order to have sufficient time to take required language courses and to complete major requirements. Students interested in exploring the major should consult the undergraduate student services adviser as early as possible to plan an individualized course of study at the Scandinavian department office in 6303 Dwinelle Hall. Appointments should be made in advance by email at <a href="mailto:issaug@berkeley.edu">issaug@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Students who already have a primary major but would like to make good use of those credits earned on the EAP program or of upper division work done in Scandinavian here at Berkeley should explore the possibility of a double major or minor in Scandinavian. </p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To enter the honors program, students must have a 3.3 minimum major and overall grade point average (GPA). Majors enroll in two consecutive semesters of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SCANDIN%20145" title="SCANDIN 145" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SCANDIN 145');">SCANDIN 145</a></span> in their senior year during which they will carry out research and write an honors thesis under the guidance of a faculty member. Students who meet the GPA requirements must first consult with the undergraduate faculty adviser in order to pursue an honors thesis.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>A minor in Scandinavian adds depth to many other major courses of study, especially those with special stakes in Scandinavian material such as architecture, city planning, environmental studies, economics, history, political science, comparative literature, film, and English. It is not necessary to study a Scandinavian language to minor in Scandinavian; all upper division courses are taught in English with texts in translation and are easily accessible to students with general interests in Scandinavian culture.</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-b189d466-ec38-ea57-7964-9c275ee427a0">New minor requirements effective Fall 2015 require five upper division Scandinavian elective courses of the student’s choosing in consultation with the undergraduate student services adviser. Students with credit from EAP course in Denmark and Sweden should consult with the department faculty undergraduate advisor for assistance in determining course equivalencies that may be applied to minor electives.</span></p>
<p>Students interested in exploring the minor should consult the undergraduate student services adviser at the Scandinavian department office in 6303 Dwinelle Hall. Appointments should be made in advance by email at <a href="mailto:issaug@berkeley.edu">issaug@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>

<p><span class="legend">The department encourages all students interested in the undergraduate major in Scandinavian to declare the major as early as possible in their academic careers (even as early as the freshman and sophomore years) in order to make planning easier. Please contact the current faculty undergraduate advisor, who can provide general information, a program brochure and scheduling worksheet, necessary paperwork, and curricular advice. Students interested in declaring a major should bring a Bear Facts copy of their transcript to the advising session when the Declaration of Major Petition (available in the department) is to be filled out.</span></p>
<p>Current majors will also want to consult the Scandinavian department website link detailing upcoming courses when planning their schedules. Students with credit from EAP courses should also consult with the faculty undergraduate advisor for help in determining requirement equivalencies.</p>
<p><span class="legend">Course List, i</span>n addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters and Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which the student plans to graduate. Students who cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time should see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>New minor requirements effective fall 2015 require five upper division Scandinavian elective courses of the student’s choosing in consultation with the undergraduate student services adviser. Students with credit from EAP course in Denmark and Sweden should consult with the department faculty undergraduate advisor for assistance in determining course equivalencies that may be applied to minor electives.</p>
