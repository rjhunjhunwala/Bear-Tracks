				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3><span>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</span></h3>
<p><strong>Note: The Latin American Studies Major has been retired and folded into Global Studies.  We are no longer accepting Latin American Studies declarations.  Please visit the</strong> <strong><a href="http://globalstudies.berkeley.edu/">Global Studies website</a></strong> <strong>or the</strong> <strong><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/global-studies/">Global Studies</a></strong> p<strong>age on the Berkeley Academic Guide for more information.  </strong></p>
<p>The major in Latin American Studies (LAS) is designed to provide a balanced curriculum in the history, culture, and society of Latin America for students wishing to receive a broader perspective than is usually available through a department major. From the rich variety of offerings within and across departments, there is a wide range of possibilities to suit the interests of students. The program may be of particular interest to students who:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Plan to enter business, government, or international agency service.</li>
	<li>Wish to teach social science or language.</li>
	<li>Are preparing for graduate and professional schools.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a wide range of courses from numerous departments to suit the interests of LAS majors. Students must gain intermediate-level proficiency in their chosen language — equivalent to four college-level semesters—either Spanish or Portuguese. In addition, students pursue a multidisciplinary course of study that includes the history and literature of the region. To assist in organizing a plan of study, students are aided by participating faculty members from several departments and programs, the faculty chair of the major, major advisers in the International and Area Studies Office, and teaching associates working in the program.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Applications are accepted during the fall and spring semesters from the third week of instruction until the last day of instruction (not the last day of finals). Applications are accepted during the summer from the last week in May until the beginning of the fall semester (not the beginning of classes).</p>
<p>To declare, students must satisfy the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have completed <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATAMST%2010" title="LATAMST 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATAMST 10');">LATAMST 10</a></span> (offered in fall semester only) with a grade of C or better (C- does not satisfy this requirement); Note: LAS 10 maybe be repeated <em>only once</em> to achieve a grade of C or better. There is no equivalent for LAS 10 from California community colleges.</li>

	<li>Transfer students (only) may declare the major while enrolled in LAS 10. However, if a grade of C or better is not achieved, transfer students must repeat the course. A grade of C or better must be achieved on the second attempt.</li>
	<li>Have a major and cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher.</li>
	<li>Not be in their final semester of undergraduate work.</li>
	<li class="Default">Have attended a Major Declaration Workshop (check the IAS website at  <a href="http://iastp.berkeley.edu/">http://iastp.berkeley.edu/</a> or the posted calendar in 101 Stephens Hall for dates).</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, students are encouraged—but not required—to complete two semesters of Spanish or Portuguese or the equivalent before applying to the major.</p>
<p>To be declared, students must do three things:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Meet with an LAS adviser to review the application materials.</li>
	<li>After having met with an LAS adviser, it is highly recommended that intended LAS majors take all application materials to the LAS Chair, Professor Estelle Tarica at 5214 in Dwinelle Hall for review.</li>
	<li>Submit all the application materials to an LAS Adviser at the IAS Office in 101 Stephens Hall.</li>
</ol>
<p>A completed LAS application includes: an Application Form and Program Worksheet, current Bearfacts unofficial transcript with the course that will be counted for the major highlighted, official transcripts from all other colleges attended with coursework the student intends to count toward the major, “Petition to Declare a Major&quot; form signed by the student, Personal Statement—a typed, double-spaced, one-page essay describing the student’s interest in LAS. In the statement, students should describe their interest in the major, their career aspirations, any plans for a higher degree, future goals, and anything else relevant to studying Latin American Studies.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To be eligible for honors, students must have senior standing and a grade point average (GPA) of 3.6 in the major and 3.5 in all work completed at UC Berkeley. Completing the honors program includes a year-long course sequence (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=IAS%20H102" title="IAS H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'IAS H102');">IAS H102</a></span> in the fall and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATAMST%20H195" title="LATAMST H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATAMST H195');">LATAMST H195</a></span> in the spring) in which students learn how to formulate a hypothesis, conduct supporting research, and complete a thesis paper of approximately 75 pages or longer.</p>

<h3 class="Default">Faculty Thesis Adviser</h3>
<p class="Default">Honors students must also enlist a faculty thesis adviser with whom they will meet throughout the year to discuss the content of their thesis. Potential honors students are strongly encouraged to start early to find a faculty thesis adviser, preferably during the spring semester of their junior year, but no later than the end of September of their senior year. Most faculty will only advise on a thesis topic that is within their subject area, and many prefer to work with students they know or have taught. The completed thesis is read and evaluated by both the seminar instructor and the faculty thesis adviser.</p>
<p class="Default">Three copies of the honors thesis must be provided by the student: one for the seminar instructor, one for the student’s faculty thesis adviser, and one for reference at the IAS Office. Sample honors thesis titles include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Guatemalan Coffee Farmers and the Fair Trade Movement.</li>
	<li>The Brazilian Landless Rural Workers’ Movement (MST): Deconstructing Nonviolence Theory.</li>
	<li>Andean Fiestas: A Mirror of Cajatambo’s Reality from 1900 to 2007.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Default"><strong>Please note:</strong> There is no guarantee that students who complete the honors sequence will graduate with honors. Honors recommendations are made after graduation and are based on a number of factors including (but not limited to) major GPA, overall GPA, grade received in H195, and thesis reader recommendations. </p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Latin American Studies. LAS majors are encouraged to enhance their undergraduate degree by completing minors in other disciplines. No more than one upper division course may be used to satisfy requirements in both a major and minor.</p>
<div> </div><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://iastp.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>Repeat Rule</h3>
<p>Students who earn a grade of F, D-, D, D+ or NP may repeat the course only once. Regardless of the grade the student receives for their second attempt (including F, D-, D or D+), the student may <strong>not</strong> repeat the course a third time.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li class="Default">No more than three upper division courses taken outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science, including courses taken at other universities, EAP, study abroad and other colleges on the UC Berkeley campus, may count towards major requirements.</li>
	<li class="Default">No more than four upper division courses may be taken from the same department.</li>
	<li class="Default">Courses cannot be double-counted within the major (for example, students may not use one course to fulfill both a history requirement and an electives requirement).</li>
	<li class="Default">All courses in the major must be taken for a letter grade. The one exception is foreign language: only the fourth semester level class must be taken for a letter grade. The first, second, and third semester language classes may be taken Pass/Not Pass. </li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs, with the exception of minors offered outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>
	<li class="Default">Online courses are not accepted in the major.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding residence requirements and unit requirements, please see the College Requirements tab.</p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3><span>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</span></h3>
<p><strong>Note: The Latin American Studies Major has been retired and folded into Global Studies.  We are no longer accepting Latin American Studies declarations.  Please visit the</strong> <strong><a href="http://globalstudies.berkeley.edu/">Global Studies website</a></strong> <strong>or the</strong> <strong><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/global-studies/">Global Studies</a></strong> p<strong>age on the Berkeley Academic Guide for more information.  </strong></p>
<p>The major in Latin American Studies (LAS) is designed to provide a balanced curriculum in the history, culture, and society of Latin America for students wishing to receive a broader perspective than is usually available through a department major. From the rich variety of offerings within and across departments, there is a wide range of possibilities to suit the interests of students. The program may be of particular interest to students who:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Plan to enter business, government, or international agency service.</li>
	<li>Wish to teach social science or language.</li>
	<li>Are preparing for graduate and professional schools.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a wide range of courses from numerous departments to suit the interests of LAS majors. Students must gain intermediate-level proficiency in their chosen language — equivalent to four college-level semesters—either Spanish or Portuguese. In addition, students pursue a multidisciplinary course of study that includes the history and literature of the region. To assist in organizing a plan of study, students are aided by participating faculty members from several departments and programs, the faculty chair of the major, major advisers in the International and Area Studies Office, and teaching associates working in the program.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Applications are accepted during the fall and spring semesters from the third week of instruction until the last day of instruction (not the last day of finals). Applications are accepted during the summer from the last week in May until the beginning of the fall semester (not the beginning of classes).</p>
<p>To declare, students must satisfy the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have completed <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATAMST%2010" title="LATAMST 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATAMST 10');">LATAMST 10</a></span> (offered in fall semester only) with a grade of C or better (C- does not satisfy this requirement); Note: LAS 10 maybe be repeated <em>only once</em> to achieve a grade of C or better. There is no equivalent for LAS 10 from California community colleges.</li>

	<li>Transfer students (only) may declare the major while enrolled in LAS 10. However, if a grade of C or better is not achieved, transfer students must repeat the course. A grade of C or better must be achieved on the second attempt.</li>
	<li>Have a major and cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher.</li>
	<li>Not be in their final semester of undergraduate work.</li>
	<li class="Default">Have attended a Major Declaration Workshop (check the IAS website at  <a href="http://iastp.berkeley.edu/">http://iastp.berkeley.edu/</a> or the posted calendar in 101 Stephens Hall for dates).</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, students are encouraged—but not required—to complete two semesters of Spanish or Portuguese or the equivalent before applying to the major.</p>
<p>To be declared, students must do three things:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Meet with an LAS adviser to review the application materials.</li>
	<li>After having met with an LAS adviser, it is highly recommended that intended LAS majors take all application materials to the LAS Chair, Professor Estelle Tarica at 5214 in Dwinelle Hall for review.</li>
	<li>Submit all the application materials to an LAS Adviser at the IAS Office in 101 Stephens Hall.</li>
</ol>
<p>A completed LAS application includes: an Application Form and Program Worksheet, current Bearfacts unofficial transcript with the course that will be counted for the major highlighted, official transcripts from all other colleges attended with coursework the student intends to count toward the major, “Petition to Declare a Major&quot; form signed by the student, Personal Statement—a typed, double-spaced, one-page essay describing the student’s interest in LAS. In the statement, students should describe their interest in the major, their career aspirations, any plans for a higher degree, future goals, and anything else relevant to studying Latin American Studies.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To be eligible for honors, students must have senior standing and a grade point average (GPA) of 3.6 in the major and 3.5 in all work completed at UC Berkeley. Completing the honors program includes a year-long course sequence (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=IAS%20H102" title="IAS H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'IAS H102');">IAS H102</a></span> in the fall and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATAMST%20H195" title="LATAMST H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATAMST H195');">LATAMST H195</a></span> in the spring) in which students learn how to formulate a hypothesis, conduct supporting research, and complete a thesis paper of approximately 75 pages or longer.</p>

<h3 class="Default">Faculty Thesis Adviser</h3>
<p class="Default">Honors students must also enlist a faculty thesis adviser with whom they will meet throughout the year to discuss the content of their thesis. Potential honors students are strongly encouraged to start early to find a faculty thesis adviser, preferably during the spring semester of their junior year, but no later than the end of September of their senior year. Most faculty will only advise on a thesis topic that is within their subject area, and many prefer to work with students they know or have taught. The completed thesis is read and evaluated by both the seminar instructor and the faculty thesis adviser.</p>
<p class="Default">Three copies of the honors thesis must be provided by the student: one for the seminar instructor, one for the student’s faculty thesis adviser, and one for reference at the IAS Office. Sample honors thesis titles include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Guatemalan Coffee Farmers and the Fair Trade Movement.</li>
	<li>The Brazilian Landless Rural Workers’ Movement (MST): Deconstructing Nonviolence Theory.</li>
	<li>Andean Fiestas: A Mirror of Cajatambo’s Reality from 1900 to 2007.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Default"><strong>Please note:</strong> There is no guarantee that students who complete the honors sequence will graduate with honors. Honors recommendations are made after graduation and are based on a number of factors including (but not limited to) major GPA, overall GPA, grade received in H195, and thesis reader recommendations. </p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Latin American Studies. LAS majors are encouraged to enhance their undergraduate degree by completing minors in other disciplines. No more than one upper division course may be used to satisfy requirements in both a major and minor.</p>

			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>Repeat Rule</h3>
<p>Students who earn a grade of F, D-, D, D+ or NP may repeat the course only once. Regardless of the grade the student receives for their second attempt (including F, D-, D or D+), the student may <strong>not</strong> repeat the course a third time.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li class="Default">No more than three upper division courses taken outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science, including courses taken at other universities, EAP, study abroad and other colleges on the UC Berkeley campus, may count towards major requirements.</li>
	<li class="Default">No more than four upper division courses may be taken from the same department.</li>
	<li class="Default">Courses cannot be double-counted within the major (for example, students may not use one course to fulfill both a history requirement and an electives requirement).</li>
	<li class="Default">All courses in the major must be taken for a letter grade. The one exception is foreign language: only the fourth semester level class must be taken for a letter grade. The first, second, and third semester language classes may be taken Pass/Not Pass. </li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs, with the exception of minors offered outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>
	<li class="Default">Online courses are not accepted in the major.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding residence requirements and unit requirements, please see the College Requirements tab.</p>

This course examines the politics of development in Chile.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3><span>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</span></h3>
<p><strong>Note: The Latin American Studies Major has been retired and folded into Global Studies.  We are no longer accepting Latin American Studies declarations.  Please visit the</strong> <strong><a href="http://globalstudies.berkeley.edu/">Global Studies website</a></strong> <strong>or the</strong> <strong><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/global-studies/">Global Studies</a></strong> p<strong>age on the Berkeley Academic Guide for more information.  </strong></p>
<p>The major in Latin American Studies (LAS) is designed to provide a balanced curriculum in the history, culture, and society of Latin America for students wishing to receive a broader perspective than is usually available through a department major. From the rich variety of offerings within and across departments, there is a wide range of possibilities to suit the interests of students. The program may be of particular interest to students who:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Plan to enter business, government, or international agency service.</li>
	<li>Wish to teach social science or language.</li>
	<li>Are preparing for graduate and professional schools.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a wide range of courses from numerous departments to suit the interests of LAS majors. Students must gain intermediate-level proficiency in their chosen language — equivalent to four college-level semesters—either Spanish or Portuguese. In addition, students pursue a multidisciplinary course of study that includes the history and literature of the region. To assist in organizing a plan of study, students are aided by participating faculty members from several departments and programs, the faculty chair of the major, major advisers in the International and Area Studies Office, and teaching associates working in the program.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Applications are accepted during the fall and spring semesters from the third week of instruction until the last day of instruction (not the last day of finals). Applications are accepted during the summer from the last week in May until the beginning of the fall semester (not the beginning of classes).</p>
<p>To declare, students must satisfy the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have completed <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATAMST%2010" title="LATAMST 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATAMST 10');">LATAMST 10</a></span> (offered in fall semester only) with a grade of C or better (C- does not satisfy this requirement); Note: LAS 10 maybe be repeated <em>only once</em> to achieve a grade of C or better. There is no equivalent for LAS 10 from California community colleges.</li>

	<li>Transfer students (only) may declare the major while enrolled in LAS 10. However, if a grade of C or better is not achieved, transfer students must repeat the course. A grade of C or better must be achieved on the second attempt.</li>
	<li>Have a major and cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher.</li>
	<li>Not be in their final semester of undergraduate work.</li>
	<li class="Default">Have attended a Major Declaration Workshop (check the IAS website at  <a href="http://iastp.berkeley.edu/">http://iastp.berkeley.edu/</a> or the posted calendar in 101 Stephens Hall for dates).</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, students are encouraged—but not required—to complete two semesters of Spanish or Portuguese or the equivalent before applying to the major.</p>
<p>To be declared, students must do three things:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Meet with an LAS adviser to review the application materials.</li>
	<li>After having met with an LAS adviser, it is highly recommended that intended LAS majors take all application materials to the LAS Chair, Professor Estelle Tarica at 5214 in Dwinelle Hall for review.</li>
	<li>Submit all the application materials to an LAS Adviser at the IAS Office in 101 Stephens Hall.</li>
</ol>
<p>A completed LAS application includes: an Application Form and Program Worksheet, current Bearfacts unofficial transcript with the course that will be counted for the major highlighted, official transcripts from all other colleges attended with coursework the student intends to count toward the major, “Petition to Declare a Major&quot; form signed by the student, Personal Statement—a typed, double-spaced, one-page essay describing the student’s interest in LAS. In the statement, students should describe their interest in the major, their career aspirations, any plans for a higher degree, future goals, and anything else relevant to studying Latin American Studies.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To be eligible for honors, students must have senior standing and a grade point average (GPA) of 3.6 in the major and 3.5 in all work completed at UC Berkeley. Completing the honors program includes a year-long course sequence (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=IAS%20H102" title="IAS H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'IAS H102');">IAS H102</a></span> in the fall and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATAMST%20H195" title="LATAMST H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATAMST H195');">LATAMST H195</a></span> in the spring) in which students learn how to formulate a hypothesis, conduct supporting research, and complete a thesis paper of approximately 75 pages or longer.</p>

<h3 class="Default">Faculty Thesis Adviser</h3>
<p class="Default">Honors students must also enlist a faculty thesis adviser with whom they will meet throughout the year to discuss the content of their thesis. Potential honors students are strongly encouraged to start early to find a faculty thesis adviser, preferably during the spring semester of their junior year, but no later than the end of September of their senior year. Most faculty will only advise on a thesis topic that is within their subject area, and many prefer to work with students they know or have taught. The completed thesis is read and evaluated by both the seminar instructor and the faculty thesis adviser.</p>
<p class="Default">Three copies of the honors thesis must be provided by the student: one for the seminar instructor, one for the student’s faculty thesis adviser, and one for reference at the IAS Office. Sample honors thesis titles include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Guatemalan Coffee Farmers and the Fair Trade Movement.</li>
	<li>The Brazilian Landless Rural Workers’ Movement (MST): Deconstructing Nonviolence Theory.</li>
	<li>Andean Fiestas: A Mirror of Cajatambo’s Reality from 1900 to 2007.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Default"><strong>Please note:</strong> There is no guarantee that students who complete the honors sequence will graduate with honors. Honors recommendations are made after graduation and are based on a number of factors including (but not limited to) major GPA, overall GPA, grade received in H195, and thesis reader recommendations. </p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Latin American Studies. LAS majors are encouraged to enhance their undergraduate degree by completing minors in other disciplines. No more than one upper division course may be used to satisfy requirements in both a major and minor.</p>

			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>Repeat Rule</h3>
<p>Students who earn a grade of F, D-, D, D+ or NP may repeat the course only once. Regardless of the grade the student receives for their second attempt (including F, D-, D or D+), the student may <strong>not</strong> repeat the course a third time.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li class="Default">No more than three upper division courses taken outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science, including courses taken at other universities, EAP, study abroad and other colleges on the UC Berkeley campus, may count towards major requirements.</li>
	<li class="Default">No more than four upper division courses may be taken from the same department.</li>
	<li class="Default">Courses cannot be double-counted within the major (for example, students may not use one course to fulfill both a history requirement and an electives requirement).</li>
	<li class="Default">All courses in the major must be taken for a letter grade. The one exception is foreign language: only the fourth semester level class must be taken for a letter grade. The first, second, and third semester language classes may be taken Pass/Not Pass. </li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs, with the exception of minors offered outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>
	<li class="Default">Online courses are not accepted in the major.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding residence requirements and unit requirements, please see the College Requirements tab.</p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3><span>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</span></h3>
<p><strong>Note: The Latin American Studies Major has been retired and folded into Global Studies.  We are no longer accepting Latin American Studies declarations.  Please visit the</strong> <strong><a href="http://globalstudies.berkeley.edu/">Global Studies website</a></strong> <strong>or the</strong> <strong><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/global-studies/">Global Studies</a></strong> p<strong>age on the Berkeley Academic Guide for more information.  </strong></p>
<p>The major in Latin American Studies (LAS) is designed to provide a balanced curriculum in the history, culture, and society of Latin America for students wishing to receive a broader perspective than is usually available through a department major. From the rich variety of offerings within and across departments, there is a wide range of possibilities to suit the interests of students. The program may be of particular interest to students who:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Plan to enter business, government, or international agency service.</li>
	<li>Wish to teach social science or language.</li>
	<li>Are preparing for graduate and professional schools.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a wide range of courses from numerous departments to suit the interests of LAS majors. Students must gain intermediate-level proficiency in their chosen language — equivalent to four college-level semesters—either Spanish or Portuguese. In addition, students pursue a multidisciplinary course of study that includes the history and literature of the region. To assist in organizing a plan of study, students are aided by participating faculty members from several departments and programs, the faculty chair of the major, major advisers in the International and Area Studies Office, and teaching associates working in the program.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Applications are accepted during the fall and spring semesters from the third week of instruction until the last day of instruction (not the last day of finals). Applications are accepted during the summer from the last week in May until the beginning of the fall semester (not the beginning of classes).</p>
<p>To declare, students must satisfy the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have completed <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATAMST%2010" title="LATAMST 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATAMST 10');">LATAMST 10</a></span> (offered in fall semester only) with a grade of C or better (C- does not satisfy this requirement); Note: LAS 10 maybe be repeated <em>only once</em> to achieve a grade of C or better. There is no equivalent for LAS 10 from California community colleges.</li>

	<li>Transfer students (only) may declare the major while enrolled in LAS 10. However, if a grade of C or better is not achieved, transfer students must repeat the course. A grade of C or better must be achieved on the second attempt.</li>
	<li>Have a major and cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher.</li>
	<li>Not be in their final semester of undergraduate work.</li>
	<li class="Default">Have attended a Major Declaration Workshop (check the IAS website at  <a href="http://iastp.berkeley.edu/">http://iastp.berkeley.edu/</a> or the posted calendar in 101 Stephens Hall for dates).</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, students are encouraged—but not required—to complete two semesters of Spanish or Portuguese or the equivalent before applying to the major.</p>
<p>To be declared, students must do three things:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Meet with an LAS adviser to review the application materials.</li>
	<li>After having met with an LAS adviser, it is highly recommended that intended LAS majors take all application materials to the LAS Chair, Professor Estelle Tarica at 5214 in Dwinelle Hall for review.</li>
	<li>Submit all the application materials to an LAS Adviser at the IAS Office in 101 Stephens Hall.</li>
</ol>
<p>A completed LAS application includes: an Application Form and Program Worksheet, current Bearfacts unofficial transcript with the course that will be counted for the major highlighted, official transcripts from all other colleges attended with coursework the student intends to count toward the major, “Petition to Declare a Major&quot; form signed by the student, Personal Statement—a typed, double-spaced, one-page essay describing the student’s interest in LAS. In the statement, students should describe their interest in the major, their career aspirations, any plans for a higher degree, future goals, and anything else relevant to studying Latin American Studies.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To be eligible for honors, students must have senior standing and a grade point average (GPA) of 3.6 in the major and 3.5 in all work completed at UC Berkeley. Completing the honors program includes a year-long course sequence (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=IAS%20H102" title="IAS H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'IAS H102');">IAS H102</a></span> in the fall and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATAMST%20H195" title="LATAMST H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATAMST H195');">LATAMST H195</a></span> in the spring) in which students learn how to formulate a hypothesis, conduct supporting research, and complete a thesis paper of approximately 75 pages or longer.</p>

<h3 class="Default">Faculty Thesis Adviser</h3>
<p class="Default">Honors students must also enlist a faculty thesis adviser with whom they will meet throughout the year to discuss the content of their thesis. Potential honors students are strongly encouraged to start early to find a faculty thesis adviser, preferably during the spring semester of their junior year, but no later than the end of September of their senior year. Most faculty will only advise on a thesis topic that is within their subject area, and many prefer to work with students they know or have taught. The completed thesis is read and evaluated by both the seminar instructor and the faculty thesis adviser.</p>
<p class="Default">Three copies of the honors thesis must be provided by the student: one for the seminar instructor, one for the student’s faculty thesis adviser, and one for reference at the IAS Office. Sample honors thesis titles include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Guatemalan Coffee Farmers and the Fair Trade Movement.</li>
	<li>The Brazilian Landless Rural Workers’ Movement (MST): Deconstructing Nonviolence Theory.</li>
	<li>Andean Fiestas: A Mirror of Cajatambo’s Reality from 1900 to 2007.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Default"><strong>Please note:</strong> There is no guarantee that students who complete the honors sequence will graduate with honors. Honors recommendations are made after graduation and are based on a number of factors including (but not limited to) major GPA, overall GPA, grade received in H195, and thesis reader recommendations. </p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Latin American Studies. LAS majors are encouraged to enhance their undergraduate degree by completing minors in other disciplines. No more than one upper division course may be used to satisfy requirements in both a major and minor.</p>

			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>Repeat Rule</h3>
<p>Students who earn a grade of F, D-, D, D+ or NP may repeat the course only once. Regardless of the grade the student receives for their second attempt (including F, D-, D or D+), the student may <strong>not</strong> repeat the course a third time.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li class="Default">No more than three upper division courses taken outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science, including courses taken at other universities, EAP, study abroad and other colleges on the UC Berkeley campus, may count towards major requirements.</li>
	<li class="Default">No more than four upper division courses may be taken from the same department.</li>
	<li class="Default">Courses cannot be double-counted within the major (for example, students may not use one course to fulfill both a history requirement and an electives requirement).</li>
	<li class="Default">All courses in the major must be taken for a letter grade. The one exception is foreign language: only the fourth semester level class must be taken for a letter grade. The first, second, and third semester language classes may be taken Pass/Not Pass. </li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs, with the exception of minors offered outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>
	<li class="Default">Online courses are not accepted in the major.</li>
</ol>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3><span>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</span></h3>
<p><strong>Note: The Latin American Studies Major has been retired and folded into Global Studies.  We are no longer accepting Latin American Studies declarations.  Please visit the</strong> <strong><a href="http://globalstudies.berkeley.edu/">Global Studies website</a></strong> <strong>or the</strong> <strong><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/global-studies/">Global Studies</a></strong> p<strong>age on the Berkeley Academic Guide for more information.  </strong></p>
<p>The major in Latin American Studies (LAS) is designed to provide a balanced curriculum in the history, culture, and society of Latin America for students wishing to receive a broader perspective than is usually available through a department major. From the rich variety of offerings within and across departments, there is a wide range of possibilities to suit the interests of students. The program may be of particular interest to students who:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Plan to enter business, government, or international agency service.</li>
	<li>Wish to teach social science or language.</li>
	<li>Are preparing for graduate and professional schools.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a wide range of courses from numerous departments to suit the interests of LAS majors. Students must gain intermediate-level proficiency in their chosen language — equivalent to four college-level semesters—either Spanish or Portuguese. In addition, students pursue a multidisciplinary course of study that includes the history and literature of the region. To assist in organizing a plan of study, students are aided by participating faculty members from several departments and programs, the faculty chair of the major, major advisers in the International and Area Studies Office, and teaching associates working in the program.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Applications are accepted during the fall and spring semesters from the third week of instruction until the last day of instruction (not the last day of finals). Applications are accepted during the summer from the last week in May until the beginning of the fall semester (not the beginning of classes).</p>
<p>To declare, students must satisfy the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have completed <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATAMST%2010" title="LATAMST 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATAMST 10');">LATAMST 10</a></span> (offered in fall semester only) with a grade of C or better (C- does not satisfy this requirement); Note: LAS 10 maybe be repeated <em>only once</em> to achieve a grade of C or better. There is no equivalent for LAS 10 from California community colleges.</li>

	<li>Transfer students (only) may declare the major while enrolled in LAS 10. However, if a grade of C or better is not achieved, transfer students must repeat the course. A grade of C or better must be achieved on the second attempt.</li>
	<li>Have a major and cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher.</li>
	<li>Not be in their final semester of undergraduate work.</li>
	<li class="Default">Have attended a Major Declaration Workshop (check the IAS website at  <a href="http://iastp.berkeley.edu/">http://iastp.berkeley.edu/</a> or the posted calendar in 101 Stephens Hall for dates).</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, students are encouraged—but not required—to complete two semesters of Spanish or Portuguese or the equivalent before applying to the major.</p>
<p>To be declared, students must do three things:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Meet with an LAS adviser to review the application materials.</li>
	<li>After having met with an LAS adviser, it is highly recommended that intended LAS majors take all application materials to the LAS Chair, Professor Estelle Tarica at 5214 in Dwinelle Hall for review.</li>
	<li>Submit all the application materials to an LAS Adviser at the IAS Office in 101 Stephens Hall.</li>
</ol>
<p>A completed LAS application includes: an Application Form and Program Worksheet, current Bearfacts unofficial transcript with the course that will be counted for the major highlighted, official transcripts from all other colleges attended with coursework the student intends to count toward the major, “Petition to Declare a Major&quot; form signed by the student, Personal Statement—a typed, double-spaced, one-page essay describing the student’s interest in LAS. In the statement, students should describe their interest in the major, their career aspirations, any plans for a higher degree, future goals, and anything else relevant to studying Latin American Studies.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To be eligible for honors, students must have senior standing and a grade point average (GPA) of 3.6 in the major and 3.5 in all work completed at UC Berkeley. Completing the honors program includes a year-long course sequence (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=IAS%20H102" title="IAS H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'IAS H102');">IAS H102</a></span> in the fall and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=LATAMST%20H195" title="LATAMST H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'LATAMST H195');">LATAMST H195</a></span> in the spring) in which students learn how to formulate a hypothesis, conduct supporting research, and complete a thesis paper of approximately 75 pages or longer.</p>

<h3 class="Default">Faculty Thesis Adviser</h3>
<p class="Default">Honors students must also enlist a faculty thesis adviser with whom they will meet throughout the year to discuss the content of their thesis. Potential honors students are strongly encouraged to start early to find a faculty thesis adviser, preferably during the spring semester of their junior year, but no later than the end of September of their senior year. Most faculty will only advise on a thesis topic that is within their subject area, and many prefer to work with students they know or have taught. The completed thesis is read and evaluated by both the seminar instructor and the faculty thesis adviser.</p>
<p class="Default">Three copies of the honors thesis must be provided by the student: one for the seminar instructor, one for the student’s faculty thesis adviser, and one for reference at the IAS Office. Sample honors thesis titles include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Guatemalan Coffee Farmers and the Fair Trade Movement.</li>
	<li>The Brazilian Landless Rural Workers’ Movement (MST): Deconstructing Nonviolence Theory.</li>
	<li>Andean Fiestas: A Mirror of Cajatambo’s Reality from 1900 to 2007.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Default"><strong>Please note:</strong> There is no guarantee that students who complete the honors sequence will graduate with honors. Honors recommendations are made after graduation and are based on a number of factors including (but not limited to) major GPA, overall GPA, grade received in H195, and thesis reader recommendations. </p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Latin American Studies. LAS majors are encouraged to enhance their undergraduate degree by completing minors in other disciplines. No more than one upper division course may be used to satisfy requirements in both a major and minor.</p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>Repeat Rule</h3>
<p>Students who earn a grade of F, D-, D, D+ or NP may repeat the course only once. Regardless of the grade the student receives for their second attempt (including F, D-, D or D+), the student may <strong>not</strong> repeat the course a third time.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li class="Default">No more than three upper division courses taken outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science, including courses taken at other universities, EAP, study abroad and other colleges on the UC Berkeley campus, may count towards major requirements.</li>
	<li class="Default">No more than four upper division courses may be taken from the same department.</li>
	<li class="Default">Courses cannot be double-counted within the major (for example, students may not use one course to fulfill both a history requirement and an electives requirement).</li>
	<li class="Default">All courses in the major must be taken for a letter grade. The one exception is foreign language: only the fourth semester level class must be taken for a letter grade. The first, second, and third semester language classes may be taken Pass/Not Pass. </li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs, with the exception of minors offered outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>
	<li class="Default">Online courses are not accepted in the major.</li>
</ol>
