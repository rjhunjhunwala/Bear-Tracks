				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The undergraduate degree program in African American Studies exposes students to the social, political, and cultural history of African-descended people in the modern world. While its primary focus is on the United States, the program’s conceptual framework places African Americans within a broader global, diasporic dialogue about the evolving function of race in history as well as in the contemporary moment. With its interdisciplinary strengths in history, culture, and social and political institutions, the major provides students with skills in research, criticism, and writing that our graduates have taken to a variety of professional paths, including teaching, government and policy work, employment in mass media, professional schools (law, medicine, business), and graduate study in multiple fields.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Completion of, or enrollment in, the three following courses is required in order to declare the major: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%204A" title="AFRICAM 4A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 4A');">AFRICAM 4A</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%205A" title="AFRICAM 5A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 5A');">AFRICAM 5A</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%205B" title="AFRICAM 5B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 5B');">AFRICAM 5B</a></span>. For details regarding how to declare the major, please see the <a href="http://africam.berkeley.edu/content/major-requirements" target="_blank">department's website</a>.</p>

<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To be eligible for admission to the honors program, a student must have completed at least two semesters at UC Berkeley and have attained senior standing with a GPA of 3.3 or higher in all University work, as well as a 3.5 GPA or higher in the African American Studies major. Students in the program are required to take the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> senior capstone course to be completed in the fall semester of their senior year and must complete the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20100" title="AFRICAM 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 100');">AFRICAM 100</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20101" title="AFRICAM 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 101');">AFRICAM 101</a></span> prerequisites for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> (to be taken prior to or concurrently with <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span>).  Students must receive a minimum of a B or above in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> to enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20H195" title="AFRICAM H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM H195');">AFRICAM H195</a></span> (Honors Thesis) the following semester culminating in the completion of a senior honors thesis.</p>

The purpose of this course is to examine the many forms that the struggle of minorities can assume. The focus is on individual struggle and its outcome as reported and perceived by the individuals themselves. Members of three minority aggregates are considered: African Americans, Asian Americans (so called), and Chicano/Latino Americans. The choice of these three has to do with the different histories of members of these aggregrates. Such differences</span><span class="deschide"> have produced somewhat different approaches to struggle.</span><br/>

This course offers a panorama of the African historical experience from the political economic dynamics of Africa at the onset of European colonization in the late nineteenth century, through the colonial period, to our age of globalization. For better or for worse, African history and culture have shaped and have been shaped by European colonial rule and its aftermath, but we shall also give due attention to postcolonial-era structures and</span><span class="deschide"> processes in the general context of Africans’ attempts to remake their world.

The purpose of this course is to examine the many forms that the struggle of minorities can assume. The focus is on individual struggle and its outcome as reported and perceived by the individuals themselves. Members of three minority aggregates are considered: African Americans, Asian Americans (so called), and Chicano/Latino Americans. The choice of these three has to do with the different histories of members of these aggregrates. Such differences</span><span class="deschide"> have produced somewhat different approaches to struggle.</span><br/>

The course will provide an overview of the linguistic structure of African languages. Because the Bantu languages constitute the largest sub-group in sub-Saharan Africa, there will be much focus on the description of the major grammatical features of Bantu languages. The descriptions of African linguistic structure will be accompanied by insights into the contributions made by African languages to general linguistics. Data from various African</span><span class="deschide"> languages will be brought in to illustrate relevant aspects of African linguistic structure.</span><br/>

This course will expand this time frame and seek to place this movement in the context of global developments</span><span class="deschide"> and the broad sweep of United States History. Assigned readings consist of historical and autobiographical texts. Lectures will contextualize the readings by placing the material and its significance within the overall history and culture of Americans. Visual media will augment the lectures.</span><br/>

This course uses film to investigate the central role of race in American culture. Through the study of film history, from silent film of the Jim Crow era to the digitized dystopias of the 21st century, this course explores the relationship between art and politics, race and representation.

In this course, we will read books by acclaimed African American poets who h­ave won Pulitzer Prizes, National Book Awards, and commendations from the Library of Congress.

Berkeley Connect is a mentoring program, offered through various academic departments, that helps students build intellectual community. Over the course of a semester, enrolled students participate in regular small-group discussions facilitated by a graduate student mentor (following a faculty-directed curriculum), meet with their graduate student mentor for one-on-one academic advising, attend lectures and panel discussions featuring department</span><span class="deschide"> faculty and alumni, and go on field trips to campus resources. Students are not required to be declared majors in order to participate.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The undergraduate degree program in African American Studies exposes students to the social, political, and cultural history of African-descended people in the modern world. While its primary focus is on the United States, the program’s conceptual framework places African Americans within a broader global, diasporic dialogue about the evolving function of race in history as well as in the contemporary moment. With its interdisciplinary strengths in history, culture, and social and political institutions, the major provides students with skills in research, criticism, and writing that our graduates have taken to a variety of professional paths, including teaching, government and policy work, employment in mass media, professional schools (law, medicine, business), and graduate study in multiple fields.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Completion of, or enrollment in, the three following courses is required in order to declare the major: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%204A" title="AFRICAM 4A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 4A');">AFRICAM 4A</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%205A" title="AFRICAM 5A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 5A');">AFRICAM 5A</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%205B" title="AFRICAM 5B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 5B');">AFRICAM 5B</a></span>. For details regarding how to declare the major, please see the <a href="http://africam.berkeley.edu/content/major-requirements" target="_blank">department's website</a>.</p>

<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To be eligible for admission to the honors program, a student must have completed at least two semesters at UC Berkeley and have attained senior standing with a GPA of 3.3 or higher in all University work, as well as a 3.5 GPA or higher in the African American Studies major. Students in the program are required to take the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> senior capstone course to be completed in the fall semester of their senior year and must complete the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20100" title="AFRICAM 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 100');">AFRICAM 100</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20101" title="AFRICAM 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 101');">AFRICAM 101</a></span> prerequisites for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> (to be taken prior to or concurrently with <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span>).  Students must receive a minimum of a B or above in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> to enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20H195" title="AFRICAM H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM H195');">AFRICAM H195</a></span> (Honors Thesis) the following semester culminating in the completion of a senior honors thesis.</p>

The purpose of this course is to examine the many forms that the struggle of minorities can assume. The focus is on individual struggle and its outcome as reported and perceived by the individuals themselves. Members of three minority aggregates are considered: African Americans, Asian Americans (so called), and Chicano/Latino Americans. The choice of these three has to do with the different histories of members of these aggregrates. Such differences</span><span class="deschide"> have produced somewhat different approaches to struggle.</span><br/>

This course offers a panorama of the African historical experience from the political economic dynamics of Africa at the onset of European colonization in the late nineteenth century, through the colonial period, to our age of globalization. For better or for worse, African history and culture have shaped and have been shaped by European colonial rule and its aftermath, but we shall also give due attention to postcolonial-era structures and</span><span class="deschide"> processes in the general context of Africans’ attempts to remake their world.

The purpose of this course is to examine the many forms that the struggle of minorities can assume. The focus is on individual struggle and its outcome as reported and perceived by the individuals themselves. Members of three minority aggregates are considered: African Americans, Asian Americans (so called), and Chicano/Latino Americans. The choice of these three has to do with the different histories of members of these aggregrates. Such differences</span><span class="deschide"> have produced somewhat different approaches to struggle.</span><br/>

The course will provide an overview of the linguistic structure of African languages. Because the Bantu languages constitute the largest sub-group in sub-Saharan Africa, there will be much focus on the description of the major grammatical features of Bantu languages. The descriptions of African linguistic structure will be accompanied by insights into the contributions made by African languages to general linguistics. Data from various African</span><span class="deschide"> languages will be brought in to illustrate relevant aspects of African linguistic structure.</span><br/>

This course will expand this time frame and seek to place this movement in the context of global developments</span><span class="deschide"> and the broad sweep of United States History. Assigned readings consist of historical and autobiographical texts. Lectures will contextualize the readings by placing the material and its significance within the overall history and culture of Americans. Visual media will augment the lectures.</span><br/>

This course uses film to investigate the central role of race in American culture. Through the study of film history, from silent film of the Jim Crow era to the digitized dystopias of the 21st century, this course explores the relationship between art and politics, race and representation.

In this course, we will read books by acclaimed African American poets who h­ave won Pulitzer Prizes, National Book Awards, and commendations from the Library of Congress.

Berkeley Connect is a mentoring program, offered through various academic departments, that helps students build intellectual community. Over the course of a semester, enrolled students participate in regular small-group discussions facilitated by a graduate student mentor (following a faculty-directed curriculum), meet with their graduate student mentor for one-on-one academic advising, attend lectures and panel discussions featuring department</span><span class="deschide"> faculty and alumni, and go on field trips to campus resources. Students are not required to be declared majors in order to participate.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The undergraduate degree program in African American Studies exposes students to the social, political, and cultural history of African-descended people in the modern world. While its primary focus is on the United States, the program’s conceptual framework places African Americans within a broader global, diasporic dialogue about the evolving function of race in history as well as in the contemporary moment. With its interdisciplinary strengths in history, culture, and social and political institutions, the major provides students with skills in research, criticism, and writing that our graduates have taken to a variety of professional paths, including teaching, government and policy work, employment in mass media, professional schools (law, medicine, business), and graduate study in multiple fields.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Completion of, or enrollment in, the three following courses is required in order to declare the major: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%204A" title="AFRICAM 4A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 4A');">AFRICAM 4A</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%205A" title="AFRICAM 5A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 5A');">AFRICAM 5A</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%205B" title="AFRICAM 5B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 5B');">AFRICAM 5B</a></span>. For details regarding how to declare the major, please see the <a href="http://africam.berkeley.edu/content/major-requirements" target="_blank">department's website</a>.</p>

<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To be eligible for admission to the honors program, a student must have completed at least two semesters at UC Berkeley and have attained senior standing with a GPA of 3.3 or higher in all University work, as well as a 3.5 GPA or higher in the African American Studies major. Students in the program are required to take the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> senior capstone course to be completed in the fall semester of their senior year and must complete the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20100" title="AFRICAM 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 100');">AFRICAM 100</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20101" title="AFRICAM 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 101');">AFRICAM 101</a></span> prerequisites for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> (to be taken prior to or concurrently with <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span>).  Students must receive a minimum of a B or above in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> to enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20H195" title="AFRICAM H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM H195');">AFRICAM H195</a></span> (Honors Thesis) the following semester culminating in the completion of a senior honors thesis.</p>

The purpose of this course is to examine the many forms that the struggle of minorities can assume. The focus is on individual struggle and its outcome as reported and perceived by the individuals themselves. Members of three minority aggregates are considered: African Americans, Asian Americans (so called), and Chicano/Latino Americans. The choice of these three has to do with the different histories of members of these aggregrates. Such differences</span><span class="deschide"> have produced somewhat different approaches to struggle.</span><br/>

This course offers a panorama of the African historical experience from the political economic dynamics of Africa at the onset of European colonization in the late nineteenth century, through the colonial period, to our age of globalization. For better or for worse, African history and culture have shaped and have been shaped by European colonial rule and its aftermath, but we shall also give due attention to postcolonial-era structures and</span><span class="deschide"> processes in the general context of Africans’ attempts to remake their world.

The purpose of this course is to examine the many forms that the struggle of minorities can assume. The focus is on individual struggle and its outcome as reported and perceived by the individuals themselves. Members of three minority aggregates are considered: African Americans, Asian Americans (so called), and Chicano/Latino Americans. The choice of these three has to do with the different histories of members of these aggregrates. Such differences</span><span class="deschide"> have produced somewhat different approaches to struggle.</span><br/>

The course will provide an overview of the linguistic structure of African languages. Because the Bantu languages constitute the largest sub-group in sub-Saharan Africa, there will be much focus on the description of the major grammatical features of Bantu languages. The descriptions of African linguistic structure will be accompanied by insights into the contributions made by African languages to general linguistics. Data from various African</span><span class="deschide"> languages will be brought in to illustrate relevant aspects of African linguistic structure.</span><br/>

This course will expand this time frame and seek to place this movement in the context of global developments</span><span class="deschide"> and the broad sweep of United States History. Assigned readings consist of historical and autobiographical texts. Lectures will contextualize the readings by placing the material and its significance within the overall history and culture of Americans. Visual media will augment the lectures.</span><br/>

This course uses film to investigate the central role of race in American culture. Through the study of film history, from silent film of the Jim Crow era to the digitized dystopias of the 21st century, this course explores the relationship between art and politics, race and representation.

In this course, we will read books by acclaimed African American poets who h­ave won Pulitzer Prizes, National Book Awards, and commendations from the Library of Congress.

Berkeley Connect is a mentoring program, offered through various academic departments, that helps students build intellectual community. Over the course of a semester, enrolled students participate in regular small-group discussions facilitated by a graduate student mentor (following a faculty-directed curriculum), meet with their graduate student mentor for one-on-one academic advising, attend lectures and panel discussions featuring department</span><span class="deschide"> faculty and alumni, and go on field trips to campus resources. Students are not required to be declared majors in order to participate.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The undergraduate degree program in African American Studies exposes students to the social, political, and cultural history of African-descended people in the modern world. While its primary focus is on the United States, the program’s conceptual framework places African Americans within a broader global, diasporic dialogue about the evolving function of race in history as well as in the contemporary moment. With its interdisciplinary strengths in history, culture, and social and political institutions, the major provides students with skills in research, criticism, and writing that our graduates have taken to a variety of professional paths, including teaching, government and policy work, employment in mass media, professional schools (law, medicine, business), and graduate study in multiple fields.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Completion of, or enrollment in, the three following courses is required in order to declare the major: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%204A" title="AFRICAM 4A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 4A');">AFRICAM 4A</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%205A" title="AFRICAM 5A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 5A');">AFRICAM 5A</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%205B" title="AFRICAM 5B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 5B');">AFRICAM 5B</a></span>. For details regarding how to declare the major, please see the <a href="http://africam.berkeley.edu/content/major-requirements" target="_blank">department's website</a>.</p>

<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To be eligible for admission to the honors program, a student must have completed at least two semesters at UC Berkeley and have attained senior standing with a GPA of 3.3 or higher in all University work, as well as a 3.5 GPA or higher in the African American Studies major. Students in the program are required to take the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> senior capstone course to be completed in the fall semester of their senior year and must complete the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20100" title="AFRICAM 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 100');">AFRICAM 100</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20101" title="AFRICAM 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 101');">AFRICAM 101</a></span> prerequisites for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> (to be taken prior to or concurrently with <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span>).  Students must receive a minimum of a B or above in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> to enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20H195" title="AFRICAM H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM H195');">AFRICAM H195</a></span> (Honors Thesis) the following semester culminating in the completion of a senior honors thesis.</p>

The purpose of this course is to examine the many forms that the struggle of minorities can assume. The focus is on individual struggle and its outcome as reported and perceived by the individuals themselves. Members of three minority aggregates are considered: African Americans, Asian Americans (so called), and Chicano/Latino Americans. The choice of these three has to do with the different histories of members of these aggregrates. Such differences</span><span class="deschide"> have produced somewhat different approaches to struggle.</span><br/>

This course offers a panorama of the African historical experience from the political economic dynamics of Africa at the onset of European colonization in the late nineteenth century, through the colonial period, to our age of globalization. For better or for worse, African history and culture have shaped and have been shaped by European colonial rule and its aftermath, but we shall also give due attention to postcolonial-era structures and</span><span class="deschide"> processes in the general context of Africans’ attempts to remake their world.

The purpose of this course is to examine the many forms that the struggle of minorities can assume. The focus is on individual struggle and its outcome as reported and perceived by the individuals themselves. Members of three minority aggregates are considered: African Americans, Asian Americans (so called), and Chicano/Latino Americans. The choice of these three has to do with the different histories of members of these aggregrates. Such differences</span><span class="deschide"> have produced somewhat different approaches to struggle.</span><br/>

The course will provide an overview of the linguistic structure of African languages. Because the Bantu languages constitute the largest sub-group in sub-Saharan Africa, there will be much focus on the description of the major grammatical features of Bantu languages. The descriptions of African linguistic structure will be accompanied by insights into the contributions made by African languages to general linguistics. Data from various African</span><span class="deschide"> languages will be brought in to illustrate relevant aspects of African linguistic structure.</span><br/>

This course will expand this time frame and seek to place this movement in the context of global developments</span><span class="deschide"> and the broad sweep of United States History. Assigned readings consist of historical and autobiographical texts. Lectures will contextualize the readings by placing the material and its significance within the overall history and culture of Americans. Visual media will augment the lectures.</span><br/>

This course uses film to investigate the central role of race in American culture. Through the study of film history, from silent film of the Jim Crow era to the digitized dystopias of the 21st century, this course explores the relationship between art and politics, race and representation.

In this course, we will read books by acclaimed African American poets who h­ave won Pulitzer Prizes, National Book Awards, and commendations from the Library of Congress.

Berkeley Connect is a mentoring program, offered through various academic departments, that helps students build intellectual community. Over the course of a semester, enrolled students participate in regular small-group discussions facilitated by a graduate student mentor (following a faculty-directed curriculum), meet with their graduate student mentor for one-on-one academic advising, attend lectures and panel discussions featuring department</span><span class="deschide"> faculty and alumni, and go on field trips to campus resources. Students are not required to be declared majors in order to participate.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The undergraduate degree program in African American Studies exposes students to the social, political, and cultural history of African-descended people in the modern world. While its primary focus is on the United States, the program’s conceptual framework places African Americans within a broader global, diasporic dialogue about the evolving function of race in history as well as in the contemporary moment. With its interdisciplinary strengths in history, culture, and social and political institutions, the major provides students with skills in research, criticism, and writing that our graduates have taken to a variety of professional paths, including teaching, government and policy work, employment in mass media, professional schools (law, medicine, business), and graduate study in multiple fields.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Completion of, or enrollment in, the three following courses is required in order to declare the major: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%204A" title="AFRICAM 4A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 4A');">AFRICAM 4A</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%205A" title="AFRICAM 5A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 5A');">AFRICAM 5A</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%205B" title="AFRICAM 5B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 5B');">AFRICAM 5B</a></span>. For details regarding how to declare the major, please see the <a href="http://africam.berkeley.edu/content/major-requirements" target="_blank">department's website</a>.</p>

<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To be eligible for admission to the honors program, a student must have completed at least two semesters at UC Berkeley and have attained senior standing with a GPA of 3.3 or higher in all University work, as well as a 3.5 GPA or higher in the African American Studies major. Students in the program are required to take the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> senior capstone course to be completed in the fall semester of their senior year and must complete the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20100" title="AFRICAM 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 100');">AFRICAM 100</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20101" title="AFRICAM 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 101');">AFRICAM 101</a></span> prerequisites for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> (to be taken prior to or concurrently with <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span>).  Students must receive a minimum of a B or above in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> to enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20H195" title="AFRICAM H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM H195');">AFRICAM H195</a></span> (Honors Thesis) the following semester culminating in the completion of a senior honors thesis.</p>

The purpose of this course is to examine the many forms that the struggle of minorities can assume. The focus is on individual struggle and its outcome as reported and perceived by the individuals themselves. Members of three minority aggregates are considered: African Americans, Asian Americans (so called), and Chicano/Latino Americans. The choice of these three has to do with the different histories of members of these aggregrates. Such differences</span><span class="deschide"> have produced somewhat different approaches to struggle.</span><br/>

This course offers a panorama of the African historical experience from the political economic dynamics of Africa at the onset of European colonization in the late nineteenth century, through the colonial period, to our age of globalization. For better or for worse, African history and culture have shaped and have been shaped by European colonial rule and its aftermath, but we shall also give due attention to postcolonial-era structures and</span><span class="deschide"> processes in the general context of Africans’ attempts to remake their world.

The purpose of this course is to examine the many forms that the struggle of minorities can assume. The focus is on individual struggle and its outcome as reported and perceived by the individuals themselves. Members of three minority aggregates are considered: African Americans, Asian Americans (so called), and Chicano/Latino Americans. The choice of these three has to do with the different histories of members of these aggregrates. Such differences</span><span class="deschide"> have produced somewhat different approaches to struggle.</span><br/>

The course will provide an overview of the linguistic structure of African languages. Because the Bantu languages constitute the largest sub-group in sub-Saharan Africa, there will be much focus on the description of the major grammatical features of Bantu languages. The descriptions of African linguistic structure will be accompanied by insights into the contributions made by African languages to general linguistics. Data from various African</span><span class="deschide"> languages will be brought in to illustrate relevant aspects of African linguistic structure.</span><br/>

This course will expand this time frame and seek to place this movement in the context of global developments</span><span class="deschide"> and the broad sweep of United States History. Assigned readings consist of historical and autobiographical texts. Lectures will contextualize the readings by placing the material and its significance within the overall history and culture of Americans. Visual media will augment the lectures.</span><br/>

This course uses film to investigate the central role of race in American culture. Through the study of film history, from silent film of the Jim Crow era to the digitized dystopias of the 21st century, this course explores the relationship between art and politics, race and representation.

In this course, we will read books by acclaimed African American poets who h­ave won Pulitzer Prizes, National Book Awards, and commendations from the Library of Congress.

Berkeley Connect is a mentoring program, offered through various academic departments, that helps students build intellectual community. Over the course of a semester, enrolled students participate in regular small-group discussions facilitated by a graduate student mentor (following a faculty-directed curriculum), meet with their graduate student mentor for one-on-one academic advising, attend lectures and panel discussions featuring department</span><span class="deschide"> faculty and alumni, and go on field trips to campus resources. Students are not required to be declared majors in order to participate.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The undergraduate degree program in African American Studies exposes students to the social, political, and cultural history of African-descended people in the modern world. While its primary focus is on the United States, the program’s conceptual framework places African Americans within a broader global, diasporic dialogue about the evolving function of race in history as well as in the contemporary moment. With its interdisciplinary strengths in history, culture, and social and political institutions, the major provides students with skills in research, criticism, and writing that our graduates have taken to a variety of professional paths, including teaching, government and policy work, employment in mass media, professional schools (law, medicine, business), and graduate study in multiple fields.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Completion of, or enrollment in, the three following courses is required in order to declare the major: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%204A" title="AFRICAM 4A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 4A');">AFRICAM 4A</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%205A" title="AFRICAM 5A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 5A');">AFRICAM 5A</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%205B" title="AFRICAM 5B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 5B');">AFRICAM 5B</a></span>. For details regarding how to declare the major, please see the <a href="http://africam.berkeley.edu/content/major-requirements" target="_blank">department's website</a>.</p>

<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To be eligible for admission to the honors program, a student must have completed at least two semesters at UC Berkeley and have attained senior standing with a GPA of 3.3 or higher in all University work, as well as a 3.5 GPA or higher in the African American Studies major. Students in the program are required to take the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> senior capstone course to be completed in the fall semester of their senior year and must complete the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20100" title="AFRICAM 100" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 100');">AFRICAM 100</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20101" title="AFRICAM 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 101');">AFRICAM 101</a></span> prerequisites for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> (to be taken prior to or concurrently with <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span>).  Students must receive a minimum of a B or above in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20195" title="AFRICAM 195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 195');">AFRICAM 195</a></span> to enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20H195" title="AFRICAM H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM H195');">AFRICAM H195</a></span> (Honors Thesis) the following semester culminating in the completion of a senior honors thesis.</p>

The purpose of this course is to examine the many forms that the struggle of minorities can assume. The focus is on individual struggle and its outcome as reported and perceived by the individuals themselves. Members of three minority aggregates are considered: African Americans, Asian Americans (so called), and Chicano/Latino Americans. The choice of these three has to do with the different histories of members of these aggregrates. Such differences</span><span class="deschide"> have produced somewhat different approaches to struggle.</span><br/>

This course offers a panorama of the African historical experience from the political economic dynamics of Africa at the onset of European colonization in the late nineteenth century, through the colonial period, to our age of globalization. For better or for worse, African history and culture have shaped and have been shaped by European colonial rule and its aftermath, but we shall also give due attention to postcolonial-era structures and</span><span class="deschide"> processes in the general context of Africans’ attempts to remake their world.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The undergraduate degree program in African American Studies exposes students to the social, political, and cultural history of African-descended people in the modern world. While its primary focus is on the United States, the program’s conceptual framework places African Americans within a broader global, diasporic dialogue about the evolving function of race in history as well as in the contemporary moment. With its interdisciplinary strengths in history, culture, and social and political institutions, the major provides students with skills in research, criticism, and writing that our graduates have taken to a variety of professional paths, including teaching, government and policy work, employment in mass media, professional schools (law, medicine, business), and graduate study in multiple fields.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Completion of, or enrollment in, the three following courses is required in order to declare the major: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%204A" title="AFRICAM 4A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 4A');">AFRICAM 4A</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%205A" title="AFRICAM 5A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 5A');">AFRICAM 5A</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%205B" title="AFRICAM 5B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 5B');">AFRICAM 5B</a></span>.

The purpose of this course is to examine the many forms that the struggle of minorities can assume. The focus is on individual struggle and its outcome as reported and perceived by the individuals themselves. Members of three minority aggregates are considered: African Americans, Asian Americans (so called), and Chicano/Latino Americans. The choice of these three has to do with the different histories of members of these aggregrates. Such differences</span><span class="deschide"> have produced somewhat different approaches to struggle.</span><br/>

Through the study of film history, from silent film of the Jim Crow era to the digitized dystopias of the 21st century, this course explores the relationship between art and politics, race and representation.

In this course, we will read books by acclaimed African American poets who h­ave won Pulitzer Prizes, National Book Awards, and commendations from the Library of Congress. We will also examine book reviews, articles, and interviews that illuminate popular and critical responses to these authors and their work. The course is designed to teach students how different poems function—through close reading, and careful attention to poems’ formal properties. Hard</span><span class="deschide"> work is required; love of the genre and confidence in one’s ability to understand it is not (as the former U.S. Poet Laureate, Natasha Trethewey, admitted recently in an interview “growing up, I didn't think I could understand poetry, I didn't think that it had any relevance to my life”).</span><br/>

The purpose of this course is to examine the many forms that the struggle of minorities can assume. The focus is on individual struggle and its outcome as reported and perceived by the individuals themselves. Members of three minority aggregates are considered: African Americans, Asian Americans (so called), and Chicano/Latino Americans. The choice of these three has to do with the different histories of members of these aggregrates. Such differences</span><span class="deschide"> have produced somewhat different approaches to struggle.</span><br/>

The course will provide an overview of the linguistic structure of African languages. Because the Bantu languages constitute the largest sub-group in sub-Saharan Africa, there will be much focus on the description of the major grammatical features of Bantu languages. The descriptions of African linguistic structure will be accompanied by insights into the contributions made by African languages to general linguistics.

This course uses film to investigate the central role of race in American culture. Through the study of film history, from silent film of the Jim Crow era to the digitized dystopias of the 21st century, this course explores the relationship between art and politics, race and representation.
