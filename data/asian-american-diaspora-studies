				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies major is dedicated to the multidisciplinary study of historical and contemporary experiences of Asian-ancestry groups in local, national and global contexts. Although attention is focused on Asians in the US, the program situates the experiences, contributions, issues, and concerns of Asian American communities within their larger transnational and diasporic contexts.</p>
<p>Connections among Asian communities in the US and around the world are explored in terms of the entangled histories and circuits of migration and the interconnected space through which people, capital, ideas, influences, and activism flow between Asia and the US and among Asian diasporic communities.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies Program provides a program leading to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree with honors. A student must have senior standing; a 3.5 GPA overall; and 3.5 GPA in the major. To complete the degree with honors, the student will be required to undertake a 6 unit research project (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASAMST%20H195A" title="ASAMST H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASAMST H195A');">ASAMST H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASAMST%20H195B" title="ASAMST H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASAMST H195B');">ASAMST H195B</a></span>) and will be graded according to standards determined by the faculty advisor as being of honors quality.</p>

The course traces Islam's journey in America. It will deal with the emergence of identifiable Muslim communities throughout the U.S. and focus on patterns of migration, the ethnic makeup of such communities, gender dynamics, political identity, and cases of conversion to Islam. The course will spend considerable time on the African American, Indo-Pakistani, and Arab American Muslim communities since they constitute the largest groupings. It also</span><span class="deschide"> examines in depth the emergence of national, regional, and local Muslim institutions, patterns of development pursued by a number of them, and levels of cooperation or antagonism. The course seeks an examination of gender relations and dynamics across the various Muslim groupings, and the internal and external factors that contribute to real and imagined crisis. The course seeks to conduct and document the growth and expansion of mosques, schools, and community centers in the greater Bay Area. Finally, no class on Islam in America would be complete without a critical examination of the impacts of 9/11 on Muslim communities, the erosion of civil rights, and the ongoing war on terrorism.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies major is dedicated to the multidisciplinary study of historical and contemporary experiences of Asian-ancestry groups in local, national and global contexts. Although attention is focused on Asians in the US, the program situates the experiences, contributions, issues, and concerns of Asian American communities within their larger transnational and diasporic contexts.</p>
<p>Connections among Asian communities in the US and around the world are explored in terms of the entangled histories and circuits of migration and the interconnected space through which people, capital, ideas, influences, and activism flow between Asia and the US and among Asian diasporic communities.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies Program provides a program leading to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree with honors. A student must have senior standing; a 3.5 GPA overall; and 3.5 GPA in the major. To complete the degree with honors, the student will be required to undertake a 6 unit research project (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASAMST%20H195A" title="ASAMST H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASAMST H195A');">ASAMST H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASAMST%20H195B" title="ASAMST H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASAMST H195B');">ASAMST H195B</a></span>) and will be graded according to standards determined by the faculty advisor as being of honors quality.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>

The course traces Islam's journey in America. It will deal with the emergence of identifiable Muslim communities throughout the U.S. and focus on patterns of migration, the ethnic makeup of such communities, gender dynamics, political identity, and cases of conversion to Islam. The course will spend considerable time on the African American, Indo-Pakistani, and Arab American Muslim communities since they constitute the largest groupings. It also</span><span class="deschide"> examines in depth the emergence of national, regional, and local Muslim institutions, patterns of development pursued by a number of them, and levels of cooperation or antagonism. The course seeks an examination of gender relations and dynamics across the various Muslim groupings, and the internal and external factors that contribute to real and imagined crisis. The course seeks to conduct and document the growth and expansion of mosques, schools, and community centers in the greater Bay Area. Finally, no class on Islam in America would be complete without a critical examination of the impacts of 9/11 on Muslim communities, the erosion of civil rights, and the ongoing war on terrorism.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies major is dedicated to the multidisciplinary study of historical and contemporary experiences of Asian-ancestry groups in local, national and global contexts. Although attention is focused on Asians in the US, the program situates the experiences, contributions, issues, and concerns of Asian American communities within their larger transnational and diasporic contexts.</p>
<p>Connections among Asian communities in the US and around the world are explored in terms of the entangled histories and circuits of migration and the interconnected space through which people, capital, ideas, influences, and activism flow between Asia and the US and among Asian diasporic communities.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies Program provides a program leading to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree with honors. A student must have senior standing; a 3.5 GPA overall; and 3.5 GPA in the major. To complete the degree with honors, the student will be required to undertake a 6 unit research project (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASAMST%20H195A" title="ASAMST H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASAMST H195A');">ASAMST H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASAMST%20H195B" title="ASAMST H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASAMST H195B');">ASAMST H195B</a></span>) and will be graded according to standards determined by the faculty advisor as being of honors quality.</p>

The course will spend considerable time on the African American, Indo-Pakistani, and Arab American Muslim communities since they constitute the largest groupings. It also</span><span class="deschide"> examines in depth the emergence of national, regional, and local Muslim institutions, patterns of development pursued by a number of them, and levels of cooperation or antagonism.

The course seeks to conduct and document the growth and expansion of mosques, schools, and community centers in the greater Bay Area. Finally, no class on Islam in America would be complete without a critical examination of the impacts of 9/11 on Muslim communities, the erosion of civil rights, and the ongoing war on terrorism.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies major is dedicated to the multidisciplinary study of historical and contemporary experiences of Asian-ancestry groups in local, national and global contexts. Although attention is focused on Asians in the US, the program situates the experiences, contributions, issues, and concerns of Asian American communities within their larger transnational and diasporic contexts.</p>
<p>Connections among Asian communities in the US and around the world are explored in terms of the entangled histories and circuits of migration and the interconnected space through which people, capital, ideas, influences, and activism flow between Asia and the US and among Asian diasporic communities.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies Program provides a program leading to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree with honors. A student must have senior standing; a 3.5 GPA overall; and 3.5 GPA in the major. To complete the degree with honors, the student will be required to undertake a 6 unit research project (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASAMST%20H195A" title="ASAMST H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASAMST H195A');">ASAMST H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASAMST%20H195B" title="ASAMST H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASAMST H195B');">ASAMST H195B</a></span>) and will be graded according to standards determined by the faculty advisor as being of honors quality.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>

The course traces Islam's journey in America. It will deal with the emergence of identifiable Muslim communities throughout the U.S. and focus on patterns of migration, the ethnic makeup of such communities, gender dynamics, political identity, and cases of conversion to Islam. The course will spend considerable time on the African American, Indo-Pakistani, and Arab American Muslim communities since they constitute the largest groupings. It also</span><span class="deschide"> examines in depth the emergence of national, regional, and local Muslim institutions, patterns of development pursued by a number of them, and levels of cooperation or antagonism. The course seeks an examination of gender relations and dynamics across the various Muslim groupings, and the internal and external factors that contribute to real and imagined crisis. The course seeks to conduct and document the growth and expansion of mosques, schools, and community centers in the greater Bay Area. Finally, no class on Islam in America would be complete without a critical examination of the impacts of 9/11 on Muslim communities, the erosion of civil rights, and the ongoing war on terrorism.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies major is dedicated to the multidisciplinary study of historical and contemporary experiences of Asian-ancestry groups in local, national and global contexts. Although attention is focused on Asians in the US, the program situates the experiences, contributions, issues, and concerns of Asian American communities within their larger transnational and diasporic contexts.</p>
<p>Connections among Asian communities in the US and around the world are explored in terms of the entangled histories and circuits of migration and the interconnected space through which people, capital, ideas, influences, and activism flow between Asia and the US and among Asian diasporic communities.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies Program provides a program leading to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree with honors. A student must have senior standing; a 3.5 GPA overall; and 3.5 GPA in the major. To complete the degree with honors, the student will be required to undertake a 6 unit research project (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASAMST%20H195A" title="ASAMST H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASAMST H195A');">ASAMST H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASAMST%20H195B" title="ASAMST H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASAMST H195B');">ASAMST H195B</a></span>) and will be graded according to standards determined by the faculty advisor as being of honors quality.</p>

The course traces Islam's journey in America. It will deal with the emergence of identifiable Muslim communities throughout the U.S. and focus on patterns of migration, the ethnic makeup of such communities, gender dynamics, political identity, and cases of conversion to Islam. The course will spend considerable time on the African American, Indo-Pakistani, and Arab American Muslim communities since they constitute the largest groupings. It also</span><span class="deschide"> examines in depth the emergence of national, regional, and local Muslim institutions, patterns of development pursued by a number of them, and levels of cooperation or antagonism. The course seeks an examination of gender relations and dynamics across the various Muslim groupings, and the internal and external factors that contribute to real and imagined crisis. The course seeks to conduct and document the growth and expansion of mosques, schools, and community centers in the greater Bay Area. Finally, no class on Islam in America would be complete without a critical examination of the impacts of 9/11 on Muslim communities, the erosion of civil rights, and the ongoing war on terrorism.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies major is dedicated to the multidisciplinary study of historical and contemporary experiences of Asian-ancestry groups in local, national and global contexts. Although attention is focused on Asians in the US, the program situates the experiences, contributions, issues, and concerns of Asian American communities within their larger transnational and diasporic contexts.</p>
<p>Connections among Asian communities in the US and around the world are explored in terms of the entangled histories and circuits of migration and the interconnected space through which people, capital, ideas, influences, and activism flow between Asia and the US and among Asian diasporic communities.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies Program provides a program leading to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree with honors. A student must have senior standing; a 3.5 GPA overall; and 3.5 GPA in the major. To complete the degree with honors, the student will be required to undertake a 6 unit research project (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASAMST%20H195A" title="ASAMST H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASAMST H195A');">ASAMST H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASAMST%20H195B" title="ASAMST H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASAMST H195B');">ASAMST H195B</a></span>) and will be graded according to standards determined by the faculty advisor as being of honors quality.</p>

<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>

The course traces Islam's journey in America. It will deal with the emergence of identifiable Muslim communities throughout the U.S. and focus on patterns of migration, the ethnic makeup of such communities, gender dynamics, political identity, and cases of conversion to Islam. The course will spend considerable time on the African American, Indo-Pakistani, and Arab American Muslim communities since they constitute the largest groupings. It also</span><span class="deschide"> examines in depth the emergence of national, regional, and local Muslim institutions, patterns of development pursued by a number of them, and levels of cooperation or antagonism. The course seeks an examination of gender relations and dynamics across the various Muslim groupings, and the internal and external factors that contribute to real and imagined crisis. The course seeks to conduct and document the growth and expansion of mosques, schools, and community centers in the greater Bay Area. Finally, no class on Islam in America would be complete without a critical examination of the impacts of 9/11 on Muslim communities, the erosion of civil rights, and the ongoing war on terrorism.</span><br/>
