				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p><strong>Note: The Peace &amp; Conflict Studies Major has been retired and folded into Global Studies.  We are no longer accepting Peace &amp; Conflict Studies declarations.  Please visit the</strong> <strong><a href="http://globalstudies.berkeley.edu/">Global Studies website</a></strong> <strong>or the</strong> <strong><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/global-studies/">Global Studies</a></strong> p<strong>age on the Berkeley Academic Guide for more information. </strong></p>
<p>Peace and Conflict Studies has been an undergraduate major at UC Berkeley since 1985. Peace and Conflict Studies (PACS) was founded on the belief that war and other forms of conflict, despite their ubiquity, can be mitigated and transformed through critical knowledge and active engagement. PACS, as an interdisciplinary major, provides students with both the academic training and the tools to engage critically the complex issues of conflict and peace in local, national and global contexts. Hence it is excellent training and preparation for postgraduate education in social science disciplines or careers in either the public or private sectors. The ultimate goal of the program is to produce not only a generation of well-informed students but also global citizens who are actively engaged in the change process.</p>
<p>Towards these ends, the PACS major’s requirements are designed to help students develop an integrative understanding of global issues, conflict resolution and peacebuilding theories, research, and practice. They are structured to provide students with both breadth of knowledge through the major’s core and concentration courses, and depth of knowledge through the concentration and senior capstone project. In consultation with an academic adviser, students choose courses that will fulfill major requirements, select a concentration, and propose an academic plan that reflects clear intellectual coherence. The areas of concentration are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Human Rights and Human Security</li>
	<li>Conflict Resolution and Peace Building</li>
	<li>National Politics, International Institutions, and World Order</li>
	<li>Student’s self-designed concentration</li>
</ul>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Applications are accepted during fall and spring semesters beginning the third week of instruction and through the last week of instruction (not the week of finals). Applications are accepted during summer session beginning in June through mid-August.</p>
<p>Students who have completed the required prerequisite coursework may apply to PACS in their freshmen or sophomore year. We recommend that students interested in declaring a major in Peace and Conflict Studies do so at least 2 semesters prior to the semester in which they intend to graduate. If students are ineligible to declare PACS at that time (please see the Eligibility to Declare section below), they should see an L&amp;S adviser to discuss their options. Students may not declare and graduate in the same semester.</p>
<p><span>Declaring a major in Peace and Conflict Studies follows guidelines established by the College of Letters &amp; Science (L&amp;S). Students wishing to declare PACS:</span></p>
<ol>
	<li>Must be currently enrolled in or have completed <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PACS%2010" title="PACS 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PACS 10');">PACS 10</a></span> with a grade of C or better (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PACS%2010" title="PACS 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PACS 10');">PACS 10</a></span> can be repeated only once in order to obtain a grade of &quot;C&quot; or better; there are no transferable equivalents for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PACS%2010" title="PACS 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PACS 10');">PACS 10</a></span> from California community colleges).</li>

	<li>Have a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 or higher.</li>
	<li>Must have attended a major declaration workshop.</li>
	<li>Must not be in their final semester of undergraduate work.</li>
	<li>Are encouraged but not required to have completed at least two semesters of college-level foreign language or the equivalent before applying to the major.</li>
</ol>

<p>To declare the major, students must meet with a program adviser in person to submit the PACS application materials.</p>
<p>Bring a completed PACS Application, including all materials and transcripts listed below, to the IAS Office at 101 Stephens Hall. The PACS application can be found on the PACS webpage: <a href="http://iastp.berkeley.edu/pacs">http://iastp.berkeley.edu/pacs</a>. Students will not be officially declared until they have submitted all declaration materials.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To graduate with honors from the group major in Peace and Conflict Studies, students must enroll in the two-semester honors seminar, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=IAS%20H102" title="IAS H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'IAS H102');">IAS H102</a></span> (fall only) and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PACS%20H195" title="PACS H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PACS H195');">PACS H195</a></span> (spring only), and must obtain GPAs of 3.6 in the major and 3.5 in overall university coursework. The honors seminar (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PACS%20H195" title="PACS H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PACS H195');">PACS H195</a></span>) is taken in addition to a student's regular coursework for fulfilling requirements for the major and culminates in the writing of a senior thesis. The thesis is read by the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PACS%20H195" title="PACS H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PACS H195');">PACS H195</a></span> instructor and at least one other faculty member who is selected by the student in consultation with the thesis class instructor. Eligibility for participating in the honors program is determined in the IAS office. <em>Note:</em> There is no guarantee that students accepted into the honors program will graduate with honors. Honors recommendations are made after graduation and are based on a number of factors including (but not limited to) major GPA, grades received for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=IAS%20H102" title="IAS H102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'IAS H102');">IAS H102</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PACS%20H195" title="PACS H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PACS H195');">PACS H195</a></span>, and faculty adviser recommendations.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The PACS minor is open to all undergraduates except PACS majors. Applications for the minor and a list of approved courses are available from the IAS office. To apply for the minor, students must have completed at least one PACS course with a grade of B or better and have an overall GPA of 2.0. Completed applications and a Petition for Confirmation of Minor Program must be submitted to the IAS office at 101 Stephens Hall no later than the last day of instruction of the term immediately preceding your final semester.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://iastp.berkeley.edu/pacs" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

<h3>Foreign Language Requirement</h3>
<p>Peace and Conflict Studies (PACS) majors must demonstrate proficiency in a modern language other than English by the last semester of their senior year. Proficiency is equivalent to the ability achieved in four college-level semesters (two years). Language courses taken in high school do not satisfy this requirement. See below for details on how to fulfill the foreign language requirement.</p>
<p><span>Languages accepted by the College of Letters &amp; Science are not automatically accepted by the PACS department. Please check with a PACS adviser for eligible languages.</span></p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to fulfill the four-semester language requirement for PACS, depending on the individual and his or her background and ability:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) test:</strong> An AP score of 5 or an International Baccalaureate (IB) score of 7 will complete this requirement. An AP score of 4 will place a student into the fourth-semester college level course. A score of 3 will place a student into the third-semester college level course. Documentation of AP scores must be provided.</li>
	<li><strong>Coursework</strong>: Any combination of college courses, summer programs, or college-level study abroad programs can satisfy the language requirement. At a minimum, students must complete the fourth semester (i.e., the second semester of intermediate level) of a language with a grade of C- or better in order to fulfill the requirement. The first, second, and third-level courses may be taken on a <em>Pass/No Pass </em>basis. Language courses need not be taken at UCB. Courses taken at a community college or any accredited school or university may be acceptable. Transcripts must be submitted and evaluated by a PACS adviser. A one-semester upper division course taken abroad in the target language may satisfy the foreign language requirement, depending on the school and program followed. For more information, see a PACS adviser concerning language study abroad.</li>
	<li><strong>Proficiency exam</strong>: Some, but not all, language departments on campus offer proficiency testing for students with advanced skills in that language. Please note that if a particular language is not taught on the UC Berkeley campus, then students are not able to test in that language. A student would then need to choose one of the other methods for fulfilling the foreign language requirement. Please speak with a PACS adviser about proficiency testing.</li>
	<li><strong>High school completion in a non-English language</strong>: Students who were educated in a non-English language through the completion of high school or the equivalent may wish to satisfy this requirement with that <span>experience. </span>This requires a language proficiency exam. </li>

<h3>Completing the Concentration</h3>
<p>To complete a concentration, students must:</p>
<p>1. Construct and submit a thoughtful course list, along with a statement about the intellectual coherence of the courses proposed. In constructing this list, students must clearly demonstrate the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>How the proposed courses align with the selected concentration topic.</li>
	<li>How the proposed courses align with one another.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Take five courses that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Have explicit content focus in the proposed or selected concentration topic.</li>
	<li>Clearly relate to each other.</li>
	<li>As a cluster, present a coherent intellectual trajectory.</li>
	<li>Include at least two courses from PACS.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Secure approval from the IAS Faculty Committee for the proposed academic plan; IAS advisers will keep students apprised of their progress towards program approval.</p>
<h3>Pre-Designed Concentration Descriptions</h3>
<h4>Conflict Resolution and Peace Building</h4>
<p>Courses in this concentration engage students in the analysis of the root causes of conflict and introduce them to theories and approaches for resolving conflicts peacefully and for building foundations for sustainable peace. These include conflict management and transformation, nonviolence and mediation, and strategies of war prevention and postconflict reconciliation among state and non-state actors at global, national, and local levels. Students in this area of concentration will acquire a deeper understanding of the different forms and levels of conflict and be better prepared to engage in conflict resolution and peace building processes through theories, cutting edge research, innovative project development, and self-reflection.</p>

<h4>National Politics, International Institutions, and World Order</h4>
<p>This concentration addresses theories, concepts, and issues of governance through critical examination of structures, systems and processes through which power is exercised in local, national, regional and global arenas. It places analytic focus on formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among various political actors, namely state authorities, inter-and nongovernment organizations, private sector entities, and civil society in the articulation, contestation, and negotiation of interests. It is especially attentive to the definition and identification of key features of good governance in relationship to peace building. International relations, regimes, the United Nations system, international law and diplomacy, international, regional and community-based organizations, state and non-state actors, and transnational advocacy networks are among the topics covered in this concentration.</p>

<h4>Human Rights and Human Security</h4>
<p>This concentration focuses on empirical and theoretical discussions of relevant issues of well-being, dignity, and equity considered as foundational to the building of sustainable peace, as they are linked to the concepts of rights, their definitions, characteristics, application, and evolution. It also examines local, regional, and global forces and conditions that assist or undermine their promotion, as well as addresses the roles and obligations, both normative and legal, of states and non-state actors in mitigating the many forms of threats that encroach upon the rights of individuals and communities and advancing human rights and human security agendas. Students will be introduced to the intellectual and situated histories of rights regimes and given an opportunity not only to engage the discourse on human rights and human security but to also explore ways to contribute to their advancement. Topics in this concentration include traditional notions of security as embedded in the notion of “freedom from fear” as well as the people-centered human security concerns with the protection and promotion of the survival and well being of individuals and groups such as economic security, food security, health security, environmental security, community security, and political security.</p>

<h3>Self-Designed Concentration</h3>
<p>Students must submit the Self-Designed Concentration Approval Form, along with a 1-2 page statement explaining how the proposed courses align with the proposed topic and how the courses align with each other. Students must propose five courses of their choosing, two of which must be PACS courses. PACS advisers are available to meet with students regarding their concentration proposals.</p>
<p><span>To get started on the Self-Designed Concentration, students should think about an existing or potential issue or question in peace and conflict studies. Then they should choose four courses that will inform or increase their understanding about that issue. These courses should all relate to the topic as well as to one another.</span> Students are encouraged to be imaginative in defining a Concentration. A concentration issue is formulated by the student with the assistance of a PACS adviser who can help to explain, clarify, or perhaps challenge that issue.</p>
<p><span>W</span><span>h</span><span>en choosing concentration courses, students should be mindful of the following:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span>No more than two courses from the same department may count toward the concentration.</span></li>
	<li>Only courses that are demonstrably relevant to the concentration topic will be approved. Therefore, it is not advisable for a student to take courses they hope to count for their concentration prior to getting declared. There is no guarantee they will be accepted for the major.</li>
	<li><span>Up to three courses taken abroad may count, provided they conform to the concentration topic. A syllabus in English must be provided.</span></li>
	<li><span>All courses, including those taken abroad, must be upper division, 3 units or more, and taken for a letter grade.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Getting a Concentration Approved</span></h3>
<p><span>To have a concentration approved, students must submit a two-paragraph description of the particular issue they would like to study. Students must also submit a list of their four proposed courses along with a brief explanation (1-2 sentences each) of how each course relates to their proposed concentration. Please use the form provided on the <a href="http://iastp.berkeley.edu/pacs" target="_blank">PACS website</a>.</span></p>
<p>Concentration proposals must be submitted in person to a PACS adviser along with the complete PACS application. Students may be asked to provide syllabi for certain courses. All concentration proposals are reviewed by the IAS Faculty Committee, and students are notified by email whether their concentration has been accepted or is being returned for revisions.</p>
<p>Any subsequent changes to already approved concentration topics and/or courses must be submitted to a PACS adviser for review and approval by the IAS Faculty Committee prior to altering the concentration.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p><strong>Note: The Peace &amp; Conflict Studies minor has been retired and folded into Global Studies.  We are no longer accepting Peace &amp; Conflict Studies minor declarations.  Please visit the</strong> <strong><a href="http://globalstudies.berkeley.edu/">Global Studies website</a></strong> <strong>or the</strong> <strong><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/global-studies/">Global Studies</a></strong> p<strong>age on the Berkeley Academic Guide for more information. </strong></p>
<p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which the student plans to graduate. Students who cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time should see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>

This course provides an overview to the historical, theoretical, political, and legal underpinnings that have shaped and continue to shape the development of human rights. Students are introduced to substantive topics within human rights and provided an opportunity to develop critical thinking, oral presentation, and writing skills. We discuss where the concept of human rights originates, how these ideas have been memorialized in international</span><span class="deschide"> declarations and treaties, how they develop over time, and how they are enforced and monitored. We examine a variety of issues and encourage students to think differently--to analyze world and community events through a human rights framework utilizing some of the necessary tools to investigate, research, and think critically about human rights and the roles that we may assume within this arena. The course requires two six-page papers, participation in a team debate, and an independent reading assignment.</span><br/>

After World War II, we witnessed a &quot;revolution&quot; in human rights theory, practice, and institution building. The implications of viewing individuals as equal and endowed with certain rights is potentially far reaching as in the declaration that individuals hold many of those rights irrespective of the views of their government. Yet, we also live in a world of sovereign states with sovereign state's</span><span class="deschide"> rights. We see everyday a clash between the rights of the individual and lack of duty to fulfill those rights when an individual's home state is unwilling or unable to do so. After introducing the idea of human rights, its historic development and various international human rights mechanisms, this course will ask what post-World War II conceptions of human rights mean for a number of specific issues including humanitarian intervention, international criminal justice, U.S. foreign policy, immigration, and economic rights. Looking in-depth at these five areas, we will ask how ideas about human rights, laws about human rights, and institutions to protect human rights have on how states and other global actors act, and how individuals have fared.</span><br/>

Course examines the history of progressive social movements in the San Francisco Bay Area. Combining history, sociology, urban geography, and ethnic studies, we ask: why and how these movements emerged? What cultural, racial, ethnic and political identities were drawn from, reconfigured, and created within these movements? What kinds of knowledge and institutions were created by these movements, and how have these legacies shaped (and been</span><span class="deschide"> shaped by) the geography, culture, and politics of the area. As part of the ACES program, this course also engages students in creating social movement documentation through collaborations with community partners.
