				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology offers three undergraduate major program specializations: Physiology and Metabolism, Dietetics, and Toxicology leading to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree.</p>
<p>Now is an exciting time to explore the sciences of nutrition and toxicology. The media have highlighted many questions about the role of diet in development and aging, the safety of genetically modified foods, links among diet, cancer, and chronic diseases, and the problems of global malnutrition.</p>
<p>The curriculum, driven by NST faculty research, covers a breadth of topics including functions and mechanisms of nutrient actions to the benefits and hazards of chemical agents, cultural and socio-economic determinants of human diets, and development of programs and policies to address human and environmental health and safety.</p>
<h3>Overview of Specialization</h3>
<p>The Nutritional Science: Dietetics degree prepares students for a career as a Registered Dietitian (RD). RDs translate the science of nutrition into practical applications in clinical, food service, or community settings. Graduates of this program must complete a dietetics internship and pass a national examination to become an RD.</p>
<p>The Dietetics curriculum provides an excellent foundation in the biological and chemical sciences, and a preprofessional focus on applying knowledge of nutritional sciences to benefit human health and to abate disease. The Dietetics program, known formally as the Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) prepares dietitians for positions of leadership in health care, education, industry, government, and community health, as well as in professional organizations. The program fills a community need for highly trained nutrition professionals while providing academic background for graduate study in nutrition or related fields. The program focuses on excellence in intellectual development, to the development of a professional inquiring attitude, and to equality of opportunity.</p>
<p>Graduates of this program receive preprofessional verification and are eligible to apply to supervised practice programs to receive practical training in multiple aspects of dietetics practice. Such programs generally take nine to twelve months. The DPD program director assists students in applying for supervised practice programs. Upon completion of the academic course work and a post-baccalaureate program of supervised practice, students are eligible to take the nationally administered Registration Examination. Once this exam is passed, the RD credential is earned.</p>
<p>The DPD at UC Berkeley is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics Education (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND).</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Advice on admission for freshmen and transfer students can be found on the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/#admissionstext" target="_blank">CNR Admissions Guide</a> page or the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/prospective-students" target="_blank">CNR Prospective Student website</a>. Freshman students may apply directly to the major, or they may select the College of Natural Resource's undeclared option and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. Transfer students may apply directly to the major and indicate their intended specialization through the UC application.</p>
<p>Information for current Berkeley students who would like to declare the major after admission, including information on a change of major or change of college, please see chapter 6 of the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">College of Natural Resources Undergraduate Student Handbook</a>.</p>
<h3>CNR Honors Program</h3>
<p>The honors program is individual research, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NUSCTX%20H196" title="NUSCTX H196" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NUSCTX H196');">NUSCTX H196</a></span>, for two semesters under the supervision of a faculty member. The supervised independent honors research is specific to aspects of the nutritional sciences and toxicology major, followed by an oral presentation, and written report. Acceptance in the CNR honors program is required through an application process. Students who are interested in the honors program should apply during their junior or senior year. Students must have a 3.6 grade-point average (GPA) in order to be eligible for the honors program. Please see the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/honors-program" target="_blank">CNR Honors webpage</a> or visit 260 Mulford Hall for additional information.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-e30cf206-7fff-9460-403c-61dca0325ea4">The department offers a minor program in Nutritional Sciences. The course work for the minor addresses topics in Human Nutrition and Nutrient Function. Elective options range from Nutrition in the Community to Metabolic Regulation to Human Diet. The minor is best suited for students already pursuing a bioscience degree: a background in chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, and biochemistry is necessary to be prepared to do upper division work in this field.  For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall.</span></p>
<h3>Certificate Program</h3>
<p>The full-time Individualized Supervised Practice Program (ISPP) in Dietetics prepares participants for a career as a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN). The ISPP curriculum provides experience in the application of nutrition through supervised dietetic practice at various hospitals, food service institutions, long-term care, public health, and wellness facilities across the United States.</p>

				<a name="certificaterequirementstext"></a><h2>Certificate Requirements</h2><h3>Individualized Supervised Practice Program</h3>
<p>Students who are pursuing the opportunity to be a Registered Dietitian (RD) will participate in either an internship or Individualized Supervised Practice Program (ISPP) before they are qualified to sit for the RD exam. The Dietetics Program Director works with students in seminars and 1-on-1 to help plan for either of these pathways. Below is more information about the ISPP specifically.</p>
<p>The ISPP in Dietetics prepares participants for a career as a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN). The ISPP curriculum provides experience in the application of nutrition through supervised dietetic practice at various hospitals, food service institutions, long-term care, public health, and wellness facilities across the United States. The ISPP is currently accredited by the <a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/acend" target="_blank">Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics Education</a> (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Dietetics is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field. The ISPP will offer training in various practice settings to provide participants with a strong foundation in applied dietetics. Participants of the ISPP can apply for one of two program concentrations: clinical nutrition or community nutrition.</p>
<p>The ISPP is 10 months and will generally begin in August and end in May. The ISPP requires a minimum of 1,360 hours of supervised dietetic practice in a professional work setting or alternate practice experience and 40 hours of orientation/instruction within a ten-month period. There are no courses associated with this certificate. The ISPP is full-time. Participants must meet performance standards from all preceptors and maintain professional and ethical standards as outlined in the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Code of Ethics. Upon successful completion of the ISPP, a continuing education/specialized professional (CESP) certificate program in dietetics supervised practice and verification of completion statement will be issued. A degree will not be granted.</p>
<p>For more information on earning this certificate, please see the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/UCB%20ISPP%20Handbook.pdf" target="_blank">Individualized Supervised Practice Program handbook</a>.</p>

	<li>A maximum of 4 units of physical education courses will count toward graduation.</li>
</ol>
<p>For full details around all requirements, please see our <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">Student Handbook</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/reading-composition-requirement/" target="_blank">Reading and Composition</a></p>
<p>In order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing and critical thinking all majors in the College require two semesters of lower division work in composition. Students must complete a first-level reading and composition course by the end of their second semester and a second-level course by the end of their fourth semester.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/foreign-language-requirement/" target="_blank">Foreign Language</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Foreign Language requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. It may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/quantitative-reasoning-requirement/" target="_blank">Quantitative Reasoning</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Quantitative Reasoning requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Breadth</h3>
<p>Undergraduate breadth provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program and many students complete their breadth courses in their first two years. Breadth courses are built into CNR major requirements and each major requires a different number of breadth courses and categories. The EEP major is the only CNR major that requires the entire 7 course breadth. Refer to the major snapshots on each <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/majors-minors" target="_blank">CNR major page</a> for for additional information.</p>
<h3>High School Exam Credit</h3>
<p>CNR students may apply high school exam credit (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-Level Exam) towards many College and Major Requirements. See <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/courses-grades#AP%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chat" target="_blank">AP Exam Equivalency Chart and Higher Level IB Exam Equivalency Chart</a> in the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">CNR Student Handbook</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Units Requirements</h3>
<p>Students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</p>
<ul>
	<li>At least 36 units must be upper division courses, including a minimum of 15 units of upper division courses in the College of Natural Resources.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, or 199) is allowed towards the 120 units; a maximum of four is allowed in a given semester.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 4 units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li>
	<li>Students may receive unit credit for courses graded P (including P/NP units taken through EAP) up to a limit of one-third of the total units taken and passed on the Berkeley campus at the time of graduation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Semester Unit Minimum</h4>
<p>All CNR students must enroll in at least 13 units each fall and spring semester.</p>
<h4>Semester Unit Maximum</h4>
<p>To request permission to take more than 19.5 units in a semester, please see the major adviser.</p>
<h3>Semester Limit</h3>
<p>Students admitted as freshmen must graduate within 8 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students admitted as transfer students must graduate within 4 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students who go on EAP and UCDC can petition for additional semesters. Summer session, UC Extension and non-UC study abroad programs do not count towards this semester limit. Students approved for double majors or  simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester. CNR does not limit the number of total units a student can accrue.</p>
<h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>After the term in which you achieve and exceed 90 units (senior status), you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence at the College of Natural Resources over at least 2 semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units taken while the student is a member of CNR. At least one of the two terms must be a fall or spring semester. Senior residence terms do not need to be completed consecutively. All courses offered on campus for the fall, spring, and summer terms by Berkeley departments and programs and all Berkeley online ('W') courses count. Inter-campus Visitor, Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley Washington Program, and UC Berkeley Extension units do not count toward this requirement.</p>
<p>Students may use Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that four units of coursework are completed.</p>
<h3>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>Participants in a fall, spring or summer UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, or the UC Berkeley Washington Program may meet a modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 of their final 60 semester units in residence (excluding UCEAP). At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after senior status is reached. International travel study programs sponsored by Summer Sessions and education abroad programs offered outside of the UC system do not qualify for modified senior residence.</p>
<p>Most students automatically satisfy the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year. In these cases, students should make an appointment to see an adviser to determine how they can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.</p>
<h3>Grade Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A 2.0 UC GPA is required for graduation</li>
	<li>A 2.0 average in all upper division courses required of the major program is required for graduation</li>
	<li>A grade of at least C- is required in all courses for the major</li>
</ul>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology offers three undergraduate major program specializations: Physiology and Metabolism, Dietetics, and Toxicology leading to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree.</p>
<p>Now is an exciting time to explore the sciences of nutrition and toxicology. The media have highlighted many questions about the role of diet in development and aging, the safety of genetically modified foods, links among diet, cancer, and chronic diseases, and the problems of global malnutrition.</p>
<p>The curriculum, driven by NST faculty research, covers a breadth of topics including functions and mechanisms of nutrient actions to the benefits and hazards of chemical agents, cultural and socio-economic determinants of human diets, and development of programs and policies to address human and environmental health and safety.</p>
<h3>Overview of Specialization</h3>
<p>The Nutritional Science: Dietetics degree prepares students for a career as a Registered Dietitian (RD). RDs translate the science of nutrition into practical applications in clinical, food service, or community settings. Graduates of this program must complete a dietetics internship and pass a national examination to become an RD.</p>
<p>The Dietetics curriculum provides an excellent foundation in the biological and chemical sciences, and a preprofessional focus on applying knowledge of nutritional sciences to benefit human health and to abate disease. The Dietetics program, known formally as the Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) prepares dietitians for positions of leadership in health care, education, industry, government, and community health, as well as in professional organizations. The program fills a community need for highly trained nutrition professionals while providing academic background for graduate study in nutrition or related fields. The program focuses on excellence in intellectual development, to the development of a professional inquiring attitude, and to equality of opportunity.</p>
<p>Graduates of this program receive preprofessional verification and are eligible to apply to supervised practice programs to receive practical training in multiple aspects of dietetics practice. Such programs generally take nine to twelve months. The DPD program director assists students in applying for supervised practice programs. Upon completion of the academic course work and a post-baccalaureate program of supervised practice, students are eligible to take the nationally administered Registration Examination. Once this exam is passed, the RD credential is earned.</p>
<p>The DPD at UC Berkeley is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics Education (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND).</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Advice on admission for freshmen and transfer students can be found on the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/#admissionstext" target="_blank">CNR Admissions Guide</a> page or the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/prospective-students" target="_blank">CNR Prospective Student website</a>. Freshman students may apply directly to the major, or they may select the College of Natural Resource's undeclared option and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. Transfer students may apply directly to the major and indicate their intended specialization through the UC application.</p>
<p>Information for current Berkeley students who would like to declare the major after admission, including information on a change of major or change of college, please see chapter 6 of the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">College of Natural Resources Undergraduate Student Handbook</a>.</p>
<h3>CNR Honors Program</h3>
<p>The honors program is individual research, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NUSCTX%20H196" title="NUSCTX H196" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NUSCTX H196');">NUSCTX H196</a></span>, for two semesters under the supervision of a faculty member. The supervised independent honors research is specific to aspects of the nutritional sciences and toxicology major, followed by an oral presentation, and written report. Acceptance in the CNR honors program is required through an application process. Students who are interested in the honors program should apply during their junior or senior year. Students must have a 3.6 grade-point average (GPA) in order to be eligible for the honors program. Please see the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/honors-program" target="_blank">CNR Honors webpage</a> or visit 260 Mulford Hall for additional information.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-e30cf206-7fff-9460-403c-61dca0325ea4">The department offers a minor program in Nutritional Sciences. The course work for the minor addresses topics in Human Nutrition and Nutrient Function. Elective options range from Nutrition in the Community to Metabolic Regulation to Human Diet. The minor is best suited for students already pursuing a bioscience degree: a background in chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, and biochemistry is necessary to be prepared to do upper division work in this field.  For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall.</span></p>
<h3>Certificate Program</h3>
<p>The full-time Individualized Supervised Practice Program (ISPP) in Dietetics prepares participants for a career as a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN). The ISPP curriculum provides experience in the application of nutrition through supervised dietetic practice at various hospitals, food service institutions, long-term care, public health, and wellness facilities across the United States.</p>

				<a name="certificaterequirementstext"></a><h2>Certificate Requirements</h2><h3>Individualized Supervised Practice Program</h3>
<p>Students who are pursuing the opportunity to be a Registered Dietitian (RD) will participate in either an internship or Individualized Supervised Practice Program (ISPP) before they are qualified to sit for the RD exam. The Dietetics Program Director works with students in seminars and 1-on-1 to help plan for either of these pathways. Below is more information about the ISPP specifically.</p>
<p>The ISPP in Dietetics prepares participants for a career as a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN). The ISPP curriculum provides experience in the application of nutrition through supervised dietetic practice at various hospitals, food service institutions, long-term care, public health, and wellness facilities across the United States. The ISPP is currently accredited by the <a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/acend" target="_blank">Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics Education</a> (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Dietetics is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field. The ISPP will offer training in various practice settings to provide participants with a strong foundation in applied dietetics. Participants of the ISPP can apply for one of two program concentrations: clinical nutrition or community nutrition.</p>
<p>The ISPP is 10 months and will generally begin in August and end in May. The ISPP requires a minimum of 1,360 hours of supervised dietetic practice in a professional work setting or alternate practice experience and 40 hours of orientation/instruction within a ten-month period. There are no courses associated with this certificate. The ISPP is full-time. Participants must meet performance standards from all preceptors and maintain professional and ethical standards as outlined in the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Code of Ethics. Upon successful completion of the ISPP, a continuing education/specialized professional (CESP) certificate program in dietetics supervised practice and verification of completion statement will be issued. A degree will not be granted.</p>
<p>For more information on earning this certificate, please see the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/UCB%20ISPP%20Handbook.pdf" target="_blank">Individualized Supervised Practice Program handbook</a>.</p>

			<div id="collegerequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="collegerequirementstext"></a><h2>College Requirements</h2><h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a <em>Pass/No Pass </em>basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>A minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in upper division major requirements is required.</li>
	<li>At least 15 of the 30 required upper division units must be taken in the College of Natural Resources (except for students majoring in Environmental Economics and Policy; please see the EEP major adviser for further information)(NST-Dietetics has 43 upper division requirements).</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of independent study (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, and 199) may count toward graduation, with a maximum of 4 units of independent study per semester.</li>

	<li>A maximum of 4 units of physical education courses will count toward graduation.</li>
</ol>
<p>For full details around all requirements, please see our <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">Student Handbook</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/reading-composition-requirement/" target="_blank">Reading and Composition</a></p>
<p>In order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing and critical thinking all majors in the College require two semesters of lower division work in composition. Students must complete a first-level reading and composition course by the end of their second semester and a second-level course by the end of their fourth semester.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/foreign-language-requirement/" target="_blank">Foreign Language</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Foreign Language requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. It may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/quantitative-reasoning-requirement/" target="_blank">Quantitative Reasoning</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Quantitative Reasoning requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Breadth</h3>
<p>Undergraduate breadth provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program and many students complete their breadth courses in their first two years. Breadth courses are built into CNR major requirements and each major requires a different number of breadth courses and categories. The EEP major is the only CNR major that requires the entire 7 course breadth. Refer to the major snapshots on each <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/majors-minors" target="_blank">CNR major page</a> for for additional information.</p>
<h3>High School Exam Credit</h3>
<p>CNR students may apply high school exam credit (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-Level Exam) towards many College and Major Requirements. See <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/courses-grades#AP%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chat" target="_blank">AP Exam Equivalency Chart and Higher Level IB Exam Equivalency Chart</a> in the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">CNR Student Handbook</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Units Requirements</h3>
<p>Students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</p>
<ul>
	<li>At least 36 units must be upper division courses, including a minimum of 15 units of upper division courses in the College of Natural Resources.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, or 199) is allowed towards the 120 units; a maximum of four is allowed in a given semester.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 4 units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li>
	<li>Students may receive unit credit for courses graded P (including P/NP units taken through EAP) up to a limit of one-third of the total units taken and passed on the Berkeley campus at the time of graduation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Semester Unit Minimum</h4>
<p>All CNR students must enroll in at least 13 units each fall and spring semester.</p>
<h4>Semester Unit Maximum</h4>
<p>To request permission to take more than 19.5 units in a semester, please see the major adviser.</p>
<h3>Semester Limit</h3>
<p>Students admitted as freshmen must graduate within 8 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students admitted as transfer students must graduate within 4 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students who go on EAP and UCDC can petition for additional semesters. Summer session, UC Extension and non-UC study abroad programs do not count towards this semester limit. Students approved for double majors or  simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester. CNR does not limit the number of total units a student can accrue.</p>
<h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>After the term in which you achieve and exceed 90 units (senior status), you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence at the College of Natural Resources over at least 2 semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units taken while the student is a member of CNR. At least one of the two terms must be a fall or spring semester. Senior residence terms do not need to be completed consecutively. All courses offered on campus for the fall, spring, and summer terms by Berkeley departments and programs and all Berkeley online ('W') courses count. Inter-campus Visitor, Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley Washington Program, and UC Berkeley Extension units do not count toward this requirement.</p>
<p>Students may use Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that four units of coursework are completed.</p>
<h3>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>Participants in a fall, spring or summer UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, or the UC Berkeley Washington Program may meet a modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 of their final 60 semester units in residence (excluding UCEAP). At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after senior status is reached. International travel study programs sponsored by Summer Sessions and education abroad programs offered outside of the UC system do not qualify for modified senior residence.</p>
<p>Most students automatically satisfy the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year. In these cases, students should make an appointment to see an adviser to determine how they can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.</p>
<h3>Grade Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A 2.0 UC GPA is required for graduation</li>
	<li>A 2.0 average in all upper division courses required of the major program is required for graduation</li>
	<li>A grade of at least C- is required in all courses for the major</li>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology offers three undergraduate major program specializations: Physiology and Metabolism, Dietetics, and Toxicology leading to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree.</p>
<p>Now is an exciting time to explore the sciences of nutrition and toxicology. The media have highlighted many questions about the role of diet in development and aging, the safety of genetically modified foods, links among diet, cancer, and chronic diseases, and the problems of global malnutrition.</p>
<p>The curriculum, driven by NST faculty research, covers a breadth of topics including functions and mechanisms of nutrient actions to the benefits and hazards of chemical agents, cultural and socio-economic determinants of human diets, and development of programs and policies to address human and environmental health and safety.</p>
<h3>Overview of Specialization</h3>
<p>The Nutritional Science: Dietetics degree prepares students for a career as a Registered Dietitian (RD). RDs translate the science of nutrition into practical applications in clinical, food service, or community settings. Graduates of this program must complete a dietetics internship and pass a national examination to become an RD.</p>
<p>The Dietetics curriculum provides an excellent foundation in the biological and chemical sciences, and a preprofessional focus on applying knowledge of nutritional sciences to benefit human health and to abate disease. The Dietetics program, known formally as the Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) prepares dietitians for positions of leadership in health care, education, industry, government, and community health, as well as in professional organizations. The program fills a community need for highly trained nutrition professionals while providing academic background for graduate study in nutrition or related fields. The program focuses on excellence in intellectual development, to the development of a professional inquiring attitude, and to equality of opportunity.</p>
<p>Graduates of this program receive preprofessional verification and are eligible to apply to supervised practice programs to receive practical training in multiple aspects of dietetics practice. Such programs generally take nine to twelve months. The DPD program director assists students in applying for supervised practice programs. Upon completion of the academic course work and a post-baccalaureate program of supervised practice, students are eligible to take the nationally administered Registration Examination. Once this exam is passed, the RD credential is earned.</p>
<p>The DPD at UC Berkeley is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics Education (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND).</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Advice on admission for freshmen and transfer students can be found on the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/#admissionstext" target="_blank">CNR Admissions Guide</a> page or the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/prospective-students" target="_blank">CNR Prospective Student website</a>. Freshman students may apply directly to the major, or they may select the College of Natural Resource's undeclared option and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. Transfer students may apply directly to the major and indicate their intended specialization through the UC application.</p>
<p>Information for current Berkeley students who would like to declare the major after admission, including information on a change of major or change of college, please see chapter 6 of the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">College of Natural Resources Undergraduate Student Handbook</a>.</p>
<h3>CNR Honors Program</h3>
<p>The honors program is individual research, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NUSCTX%20H196" title="NUSCTX H196" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NUSCTX H196');">NUSCTX H196</a></span>, for two semesters under the supervision of a faculty member. The supervised independent honors research is specific to aspects of the nutritional sciences and toxicology major, followed by an oral presentation, and written report. Acceptance in the CNR honors program is required through an application process. Students who are interested in the honors program should apply during their junior or senior year. Students must have a 3.6 grade-point average (GPA) in order to be eligible for the honors program. Please see the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/honors-program" target="_blank">CNR Honors webpage</a> or visit 260 Mulford Hall for additional information.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-e30cf206-7fff-9460-403c-61dca0325ea4">The department offers a minor program in Nutritional Sciences. The course work for the minor addresses topics in Human Nutrition and Nutrient Function. Elective options range from Nutrition in the Community to Metabolic Regulation to Human Diet. The minor is best suited for students already pursuing a bioscience degree: a background in chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, and biochemistry is necessary to be prepared to do upper division work in this field.  For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall.</span></p>
<h3>Certificate Program</h3>
<p>The full-time Individualized Supervised Practice Program (ISPP) in Dietetics prepares participants for a career as a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN). The ISPP curriculum provides experience in the application of nutrition through supervised dietetic practice at various hospitals, food service institutions, long-term care, public health, and wellness facilities across the United States.</p>

				<a name="certificaterequirementstext"></a><h2>Certificate Requirements</h2><h3>Individualized Supervised Practice Program</h3>
<p>Students who are pursuing the opportunity to be a Registered Dietitian (RD) will participate in either an internship or Individualized Supervised Practice Program (ISPP) before they are qualified to sit for the RD exam. The Dietetics Program Director works with students in seminars and 1-on-1 to help plan for either of these pathways. Below is more information about the ISPP specifically.</p>
<p>The ISPP in Dietetics prepares participants for a career as a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN). The ISPP curriculum provides experience in the application of nutrition through supervised dietetic practice at various hospitals, food service institutions, long-term care, public health, and wellness facilities across the United States. The ISPP is currently accredited by the <a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/acend" target="_blank">Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics Education</a> (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Dietetics is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field. The ISPP will offer training in various practice settings to provide participants with a strong foundation in applied dietetics. Participants of the ISPP can apply for one of two program concentrations: clinical nutrition or community nutrition.</p>
<p>The ISPP is 10 months and will generally begin in August and end in May. The ISPP requires a minimum of 1,360 hours of supervised dietetic practice in a professional work setting or alternate practice experience and 40 hours of orientation/instruction within a ten-month period. There are no courses associated with this certificate. The ISPP is full-time. Participants must meet performance standards from all preceptors and maintain professional and ethical standards as outlined in the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Code of Ethics. Upon successful completion of the ISPP, a continuing education/specialized professional (CESP) certificate program in dietetics supervised practice and verification of completion statement will be issued. A degree will not be granted.</p>
<p>For more information on earning this certificate, please see the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/UCB%20ISPP%20Handbook.pdf" target="_blank">Individualized Supervised Practice Program handbook</a>.</p>

<p>Students admitted as freshmen must graduate within 8 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students admitted as transfer students must graduate within 4 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students who go on EAP and UCDC can petition for additional semesters. Summer session, UC Extension and non-UC study abroad programs do not count towards this semester limit. Students approved for double majors or  simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester. CNR does not limit the number of total units a student can accrue.</p>
<h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>After the term in which you achieve and exceed 90 units (senior status), you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence at the College of Natural Resources over at least 2 semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units taken while the student is a member of CNR. At least one of the two terms must be a fall or spring semester. Senior residence terms do not need to be completed consecutively. All courses offered on campus for the fall, spring, and summer terms by Berkeley departments and programs and all Berkeley online ('W') courses count. Inter-campus Visitor, Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley Washington Program, and UC Berkeley Extension units do not count toward this requirement.</p>
<p>Students may use Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that four units of coursework are completed.</p>
<h3>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>Participants in a fall, spring or summer UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, or the UC Berkeley Washington Program may meet a modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 of their final 60 semester units in residence (excluding UCEAP). At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after senior status is reached. International travel study programs sponsored by Summer Sessions and education abroad programs offered outside of the UC system do not qualify for modified senior residence.</p>
<p>Most students automatically satisfy the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year. In these cases, students should make an appointment to see an adviser to determine how they can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.</p>
<h3>Grade Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A 2.0 UC GPA is required for graduation</li>
	<li>A 2.0 average in all upper division courses required of the major program is required for graduation</li>
	<li>A grade of at least C- is required in all courses for the major</li>
</ul>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology offers three undergraduate major program specializations: Physiology and Metabolism, Dietetics, and Toxicology leading to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree.</p>
<p>Now is an exciting time to explore the sciences of nutrition and toxicology. The media have highlighted many questions about the role of diet in development and aging, the safety of genetically modified foods, links among diet, cancer, and chronic diseases, and the problems of global malnutrition.</p>
<p>The curriculum, driven by NST faculty research, covers a breadth of topics including functions and mechanisms of nutrient actions to the benefits and hazards of chemical agents, cultural and socio-economic determinants of human diets, and development of programs and policies to address human and environmental health and safety.</p>
<h3>Overview of Specialization</h3>
<p>The Nutritional Science: Dietetics degree prepares students for a career as a Registered Dietitian (RD). RDs translate the science of nutrition into practical applications in clinical, food service, or community settings. Graduates of this program must complete a dietetics internship and pass a national examination to become an RD.</p>
<p>The Dietetics curriculum provides an excellent foundation in the biological and chemical sciences, and a preprofessional focus on applying knowledge of nutritional sciences to benefit human health and to abate disease. The Dietetics program, known formally as the Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) prepares dietitians for positions of leadership in health care, education, industry, government, and community health, as well as in professional organizations. The program fills a community need for highly trained nutrition professionals while providing academic background for graduate study in nutrition or related fields. The program focuses on excellence in intellectual development, to the development of a professional inquiring attitude, and to equality of opportunity.</p>
<p>Graduates of this program receive preprofessional verification and are eligible to apply to supervised practice programs to receive practical training in multiple aspects of dietetics practice. Such programs generally take nine to twelve months. The DPD program director assists students in applying for supervised practice programs. Upon completion of the academic course work and a post-baccalaureate program of supervised practice, students are eligible to take the nationally administered Registration Examination. Once this exam is passed, the RD credential is earned.</p>
<p>The DPD at UC Berkeley is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics Education (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND).</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Advice on admission for freshmen and transfer students can be found on the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/#admissionstext" target="_blank">CNR Admissions Guide</a> page or the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/prospective-students" target="_blank">CNR Prospective Student website</a>. Freshman students may apply directly to the major, or they may select the College of Natural Resource's undeclared option and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. Transfer students may apply directly to the major and indicate their intended specialization through the UC application.</p>
<p>Information for current Berkeley students who would like to declare the major after admission, including information on a change of major or change of college, please see chapter 6 of the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">College of Natural Resources Undergraduate Student Handbook</a>.</p>
<h3>CNR Honors Program</h3>
<p>The honors program is individual research, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NUSCTX%20H196" title="NUSCTX H196" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NUSCTX H196');">NUSCTX H196</a></span>, for two semesters under the supervision of a faculty member. The supervised independent honors research is specific to aspects of the nutritional sciences and toxicology major, followed by an oral presentation, and written report. Acceptance in the CNR honors program is required through an application process. Students who are interested in the honors program should apply during their junior or senior year. Students must have a 3.6 grade-point average (GPA) in order to be eligible for the honors program. Please see the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/honors-program" target="_blank">CNR Honors webpage</a> or visit 260 Mulford Hall for additional information.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-e30cf206-7fff-9460-403c-61dca0325ea4">The department offers a minor program in Nutritional Sciences. The course work for the minor addresses topics in Human Nutrition and Nutrient Function. Elective options range from Nutrition in the Community to Metabolic Regulation to Human Diet. The minor is best suited for students already pursuing a bioscience degree: a background in chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, and biochemistry is necessary to be prepared to do upper division work in this field.  For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall.</span></p>
<h3>Certificate Program</h3>
<p>The full-time Individualized Supervised Practice Program (ISPP) in Dietetics prepares participants for a career as a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN). The ISPP curriculum provides experience in the application of nutrition through supervised dietetic practice at various hospitals, food service institutions, long-term care, public health, and wellness facilities across the United States.</p>

<p>Students who are pursuing the opportunity to be a Registered Dietitian (RD) will participate in either an internship or Individualized Supervised Practice Program (ISPP) before they are qualified to sit for the RD exam. The Dietetics Program Director works with students in seminars and 1-on-1 to help plan for either of these pathways. Below is more information about the ISPP specifically.</p>
<p>The ISPP in Dietetics prepares participants for a career as a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN). The ISPP curriculum provides experience in the application of nutrition through supervised dietetic practice at various hospitals, food service institutions, long-term care, public health, and wellness facilities across the United States. The ISPP is currently accredited by the <a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/acend" target="_blank">Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics Education</a> (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Dietetics is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field. The ISPP will offer training in various practice settings to provide participants with a strong foundation in applied dietetics. Participants of the ISPP can apply for one of two program concentrations: clinical nutrition or community nutrition.</p>
<p>The ISPP is 10 months and will generally begin in August and end in May. The ISPP requires a minimum of 1,360 hours of supervised dietetic practice in a professional work setting or alternate practice experience and 40 hours of orientation/instruction within a ten-month period. There are no courses associated with this certificate. The ISPP is full-time. Participants must meet performance standards from all preceptors and maintain professional and ethical standards as outlined in the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Code of Ethics. Upon successful completion of the ISPP, a continuing education/specialized professional (CESP) certificate program in dietetics supervised practice and verification of completion statement will be issued. A degree will not be granted.</p>
<p>For more information on earning this certificate, please see the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/UCB%20ISPP%20Handbook.pdf" target="_blank">Individualized Supervised Practice Program handbook</a>.</p>

	<li>A maximum of 4 units of physical education courses will count toward graduation.</li>
</ol>
<p>For full details around all requirements, please see our <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">Student Handbook</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/reading-composition-requirement/" target="_blank">Reading and Composition</a></p>
<p>In order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing and critical thinking all majors in the College require two semesters of lower division work in composition. Students must complete a first-level reading and composition course by the end of their second semester and a second-level course by the end of their fourth semester.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/foreign-language-requirement/" target="_blank">Foreign Language</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Foreign Language requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. It may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/quantitative-reasoning-requirement/" target="_blank">Quantitative Reasoning</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Quantitative Reasoning requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Breadth</h3>
<p>Undergraduate breadth provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program and many students complete their breadth courses in their first two years. Breadth courses are built into CNR major requirements and each major requires a different number of breadth courses and categories. The EEP major is the only CNR major that requires the entire 7 course breadth. Refer to the major snapshots on each <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/majors-minors" target="_blank">CNR major page</a> for for additional information.</p>
<h3>High School Exam Credit</h3>
<p>CNR students may apply high school exam credit (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-Level Exam) towards many College and Major Requirements. See <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/courses-grades#AP%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chat" target="_blank">AP Exam Equivalency Chart and Higher Level IB Exam Equivalency Chart</a> in the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">CNR Student Handbook</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Units Requirements</h3>
<p>Students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</p>
<ul>
	<li>At least 36 units must be upper division courses, including a minimum of 15 units of upper division courses in the College of Natural Resources.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, or 199) is allowed towards the 120 units; a maximum of four is allowed in a given semester.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 4 units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li>
	<li>Students may receive unit credit for courses graded P (including P/NP units taken through EAP) up to a limit of one-third of the total units taken and passed on the Berkeley campus at the time of graduation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Semester Unit Minimum</h4>
<p>All CNR students must enroll in at least 13 units each fall and spring semester.</p>
<h4>Semester Unit Maximum</h4>
<p>To request permission to take more than 19.5 units in a semester, please see the major adviser.</p>
<h3>Semester Limit</h3>
<p>Students admitted as freshmen must graduate within 8 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students admitted as transfer students must graduate within 4 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students who go on EAP and UCDC can petition for additional semesters. Summer session, UC Extension and non-UC study abroad programs do not count towards this semester limit. Students approved for double majors or  simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester. CNR does not limit the number of total units a student can accrue.</p>
<h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>After the term in which you achieve and exceed 90 units (senior status), you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence at the College of Natural Resources over at least 2 semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units taken while the student is a member of CNR. At least one of the two terms must be a fall or spring semester. Senior residence terms do not need to be completed consecutively. All courses offered on campus for the fall, spring, and summer terms by Berkeley departments and programs and all Berkeley online ('W') courses count. Inter-campus Visitor, Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley Washington Program, and UC Berkeley Extension units do not count toward this requirement.</p>
<p>Students may use Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that four units of coursework are completed.</p>
<h3>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>Participants in a fall, spring or summer UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, or the UC Berkeley Washington Program may meet a modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 of their final 60 semester units in residence (excluding UCEAP). At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after senior status is reached. International travel study programs sponsored by Summer Sessions and education abroad programs offered outside of the UC system do not qualify for modified senior residence.</p>
<p>Most students automatically satisfy the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year. In these cases, students should make an appointment to see an adviser to determine how they can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.</p>
<h3>Grade Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A 2.0 UC GPA is required for graduation</li>
	<li>A 2.0 average in all upper division courses required of the major program is required for graduation</li>
	<li>A grade of at least C- is required in all courses for the major</li>
</ul>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology offers three undergraduate major program specializations: Physiology and Metabolism, Dietetics, and Toxicology leading to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree.</p>
<p>Now is an exciting time to explore the sciences of nutrition and toxicology. The media have highlighted many questions about the role of diet in development and aging, the safety of genetically modified foods, links among diet, cancer, and chronic diseases, and the problems of global malnutrition.</p>
<p>The curriculum, driven by NST faculty research, covers a breadth of topics including functions and mechanisms of nutrient actions to the benefits and hazards of chemical agents, cultural and socio-economic determinants of human diets, and development of programs and policies to address human and environmental health and safety.</p>
<h3>Overview of Specialization</h3>
<p>The Nutritional Science: Dietetics degree prepares students for a career as a Registered Dietitian (RD). RDs translate the science of nutrition into practical applications in clinical, food service, or community settings. Graduates of this program must complete a dietetics internship and pass a national examination to become an RD.</p>
<p>The Dietetics curriculum provides an excellent foundation in the biological and chemical sciences, and a preprofessional focus on applying knowledge of nutritional sciences to benefit human health and to abate disease. The Dietetics program, known formally as the Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) prepares dietitians for positions of leadership in health care, education, industry, government, and community health, as well as in professional organizations. The program fills a community need for highly trained nutrition professionals while providing academic background for graduate study in nutrition or related fields. The program focuses on excellence in intellectual development, to the development of a professional inquiring attitude, and to equality of opportunity.</p>
<p>Graduates of this program receive preprofessional verification and are eligible to apply to supervised practice programs to receive practical training in multiple aspects of dietetics practice. Such programs generally take nine to twelve months. The DPD program director assists students in applying for supervised practice programs. Upon completion of the academic course work and a post-baccalaureate program of supervised practice, students are eligible to take the nationally administered Registration Examination. Once this exam is passed, the RD credential is earned.</p>
<p>The DPD at UC Berkeley is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics Education (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND).</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Advice on admission for freshmen and transfer students can be found on the <a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/#admissionstext" target="_blank">CNR Admissions Guide</a> page or the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/prospective-students" target="_blank">CNR Prospective Student website</a>. Freshman students may apply directly to the major, or they may select the College of Natural Resource's undeclared option and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. Transfer students may apply directly to the major and indicate their intended specialization through the UC application.</p>
<p>Information for current Berkeley students who would like to declare the major after admission, including information on a change of major or change of college, please see chapter 6 of the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">College of Natural Resources Undergraduate Student Handbook</a>.</p>
<h3>CNR Honors Program</h3>
<p>The honors program is individual research, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NUSCTX%20H196" title="NUSCTX H196" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NUSCTX H196');">NUSCTX H196</a></span>, for two semesters under the supervision of a faculty member. The supervised independent honors research is specific to aspects of the nutritional sciences and toxicology major, followed by an oral presentation, and written report. Acceptance in the CNR honors program is required through an application process. Students who are interested in the honors program should apply during their junior or senior year. Students must have a 3.6 grade-point average (GPA) in order to be eligible for the honors program. Please see the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/honors-program" target="_blank">CNR Honors webpage</a> or visit 260 Mulford Hall for additional information.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-e30cf206-7fff-9460-403c-61dca0325ea4">The department offers a minor program in Nutritional Sciences. The course work for the minor addresses topics in Human Nutrition and Nutrient Function. Elective options range from Nutrition in the Community to Metabolic Regulation to Human Diet. The minor is best suited for students already pursuing a bioscience degree: a background in chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, and biochemistry is necessary to be prepared to do upper division work in this field.  For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall.</span></p>
<h3>Certificate Program</h3>
<p>The full-time Individualized Supervised Practice Program (ISPP) in Dietetics prepares participants for a career as a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN). The ISPP curriculum provides experience in the application of nutrition through supervised dietetic practice at various hospitals, food service institutions, long-term care, public health, and wellness facilities across the United States.</p>

				<a name="certificaterequirementstext"></a><h2>Certificate Requirements</h2><h3>Individualized Supervised Practice Program</h3>
<p>Students who are pursuing the opportunity to be a Registered Dietitian (RD) will participate in either an internship or Individualized Supervised Practice Program (ISPP) before they are qualified to sit for the RD exam. The Dietetics Program Director works with students in seminars and 1-on-1 to help plan for either of these pathways. Below is more information about the ISPP specifically.</p>
<p>The ISPP in Dietetics prepares participants for a career as a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN). The ISPP curriculum provides experience in the application of nutrition through supervised dietetic practice at various hospitals, food service institutions, long-term care, public health, and wellness facilities across the United States. The ISPP is currently accredited by the <a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/acend" target="_blank">Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics Education</a> (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Dietetics is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field. The ISPP will offer training in various practice settings to provide participants with a strong foundation in applied dietetics. Participants of the ISPP can apply for one of two program concentrations: clinical nutrition or community nutrition.</p>
<p>The ISPP is 10 months and will generally begin in August and end in May. The ISPP requires a minimum of 1,360 hours of supervised dietetic practice in a professional work setting or alternate practice experience and 40 hours of orientation/instruction within a ten-month period. There are no courses associated with this certificate. The ISPP is full-time. Participants must meet performance standards from all preceptors and maintain professional and ethical standards as outlined in the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Code of Ethics. Upon successful completion of the ISPP, a continuing education/specialized professional (CESP) certificate program in dietetics supervised practice and verification of completion statement will be issued. A degree will not be granted.</p>
<p>For more information on earning this certificate, please see the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/UCB%20ISPP%20Handbook.pdf" target="_blank">Individualized Supervised Practice Program handbook</a>.</p>

			<div id="collegerequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="collegerequirementstext"></a><h2>College Requirements</h2><h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a <em>Pass/No Pass </em>basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>A minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required.</li>
	<li>A minimum GPA of 2.0 in upper division major requirements is required.</li>
	<li>At least 15 of the 30 required upper division units must be taken in the College of Natural Resources (except for students majoring in Environmental Economics and Policy; please see the EEP major adviser for further information)(NST-Dietetics has 43 upper division requirements).</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of independent study (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, and 199) may count toward graduation, with a maximum of 4 units of independent study per semester.</li>

	<li>A maximum of 4 units of physical education courses will count toward graduation.</li>
</ol>
<p>For full details around all requirements, please see our <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">Student Handbook</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/reading-composition-requirement/" target="_blank">Reading and Composition</a></p>
<p>In order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing and critical thinking all majors in the College require two semesters of lower division work in composition. Students must complete a first-level reading and composition course by the end of their second semester and a second-level course by the end of their fourth semester.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/foreign-language-requirement/" target="_blank">Foreign Language</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Foreign Language requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. It may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work.</p>
<p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/quantitative-reasoning-requirement/" target="_blank">Quantitative Reasoning</a>: EEP Majors only</p>
<p>The Quantitative Reasoning requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Breadth</h3>
<p>Undergraduate breadth provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program and many students complete their breadth courses in their first two years. Breadth courses are built into CNR major requirements and each major requires a different number of breadth courses and categories. The EEP major is the only CNR major that requires the entire 7 course breadth. Refer to the major snapshots on each <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/majors-minors" target="_blank">CNR major page</a> for for additional information.</p>
<h3>High School Exam Credit</h3>
<p>CNR students may apply high school exam credit (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-Level Exam) towards many College and Major Requirements. See <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/courses-grades#AP%20Exam%20Equivalency%20Chat" target="_blank">AP Exam Equivalency Chart and Higher Level IB Exam Equivalency Chart</a> in the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">CNR Student Handbook</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Units Requirements</h3>
<p>Students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</p>
<ul>
	<li>At least 36 units must be upper division courses, including a minimum of 15 units of upper division courses in the College of Natural Resources.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, or 199) is allowed towards the 120 units; a maximum of four is allowed in a given semester.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 4 units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li>
	<li>Students may receive unit credit for courses graded P (including P/NP units taken through EAP) up to a limit of one-third of the total units taken and passed on the Berkeley campus at the time of graduation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Semester Unit Minimum</h4>
<p>All CNR students must enroll in at least 13 units each fall and spring semester.</p>
<h4>Semester Unit Maximum</h4>
<p>To request permission to take more than 19.5 units in a semester, please see the major adviser.</p>
<h3>Semester Limit</h3>
<p>Students admitted as freshmen must graduate within 8 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students admitted as transfer students must graduate within 4 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students who go on EAP and UCDC can petition for additional semesters. Summer session, UC Extension and non-UC study abroad programs do not count towards this semester limit. Students approved for double majors or  simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester. CNR does not limit the number of total units a student can accrue.</p>
<h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>After the term in which you achieve and exceed 90 units (senior status), you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence at the College of Natural Resources over at least 2 semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units taken while the student is a member of CNR. At least one of the two terms must be a fall or spring semester. Senior residence terms do not need to be completed consecutively. All courses offered on campus for the fall, spring, and summer terms by Berkeley departments and programs and all Berkeley online ('W') courses count. Inter-campus Visitor, Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley Washington Program, and UC Berkeley Extension units do not count toward this requirement.</p>
<p>Students may use Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that four units of coursework are completed.</p>
<h3>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>Participants in a fall, spring or summer UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, or the UC Berkeley Washington Program may meet a modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 of their final 60 semester units in residence (excluding UCEAP). At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after senior status is reached. International travel study programs sponsored by Summer Sessions and education abroad programs offered outside of the UC system do not qualify for modified senior residence.</p>
<p>Most students automatically satisfy the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year. In these cases, students should make an appointment to see an adviser to determine how they can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.</p>
<h3>Grade Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A 2.0 UC GPA is required for graduation</li>
	<li>A 2.0 average in all upper division courses required of the major program is required for graduation</li>
	<li>A grade of at least C- is required in all courses for the major</li>
