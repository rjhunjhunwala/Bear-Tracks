				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Department of Astronomy offers an undergraduate major and minor in Astrophysics. This major program prepares students for astrophysics graduate work or other advanced degrees in related fields, teaching, working in the field of computer applications, scientific and technical writing, a career as a field engineer, and other technical fields.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Information, including lists of required courses and forms to complete before declaring, <a href="http://astro.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-program/astrophysics-declaration">is available here</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>For honors in Astrophysics a student must fulfill the following additional requirements:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Maintain a grade point average of at least 3.5 in all courses in astronomy and related fields, and an overall grade point average of at least 3.3 in the University.</li>
	<li>Carry out an individual research or study project, involving at least 3 units of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASTRON%20H195" title="ASTRON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASTRON H195');">ASTRON H195</a></span>.</li>

</ol>

<p>The student's project is chosen in consultation with a departmental advisor, and the written report is judged by the student's research supervisor and by a departmental adviser.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Astronomy offers a minor program in Astrophysics. Students can work out the details by seeing the undergraduate major adviser in 501 Campbell Hall.</p>
<p>All the courses applied to the astrophysics minor must be taken for a letter grade. A minimum grade point average of 2.0 is required for the lower-division minor requirements as well as for the five upper-division courses used for the minor.  Only one upper-division class may overlap between your major and the Astrophysics Minor.</p>
<p>Once enrolled in the final course/courses to complete the Astrophysics Minor, students must complete the College of Letters and Science <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/minor.2019.pdf">Completion of L&amp;S Minor form</a>.</p>
<p>Turn in to the Undergraduate Adviser in 501 Campbell Hall: 1) the completed petition for the minor, and 2) a copy of transcripts (unofficial transcripts are OK) showing your completed Astrophysics courses.<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.</li>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Department of Astronomy offers an undergraduate major and minor in Astrophysics. This major program prepares students for astrophysics graduate work or other advanced degrees in related fields, teaching, working in the field of computer applications, scientific and technical writing, a career as a field engineer, and other technical fields.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Information, including lists of required courses and forms to complete before declaring, <a href="http://astro.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-program/astrophysics-declaration">is available here</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>For honors in Astrophysics a student must fulfill the following additional requirements:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Maintain a grade point average of at least 3.5 in all courses in astronomy and related fields, and an overall grade point average of at least 3.3 in the University.</li>
	<li>Carry out an individual research or study project, involving at least 3 units of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASTRON%20H195" title="ASTRON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASTRON H195');">ASTRON H195</a></span>.</li>

</ol>

<p>The student's project is chosen in consultation with a departmental advisor, and the written report is judged by the student's research supervisor and by a departmental adviser.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Astronomy offers a minor program in Astrophysics. Students can work out the details by seeing the undergraduate major adviser in 501 Campbell Hall.</p>
<p>All the courses applied to the astrophysics minor must be taken for a letter grade. A minimum grade point average of 2.0 is required for the lower-division minor requirements as well as for the five upper-division courses used for the minor.  Only one upper-division class may overlap between your major and the Astrophysics Minor.</p>
<p>Once enrolled in the final course/courses to complete the Astrophysics Minor, students must complete the College of Letters and Science <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/minor.2019.pdf">Completion of L&amp;S Minor form</a>.</p>
<p>Turn in to the Undergraduate Adviser in 501 Campbell Hall: 1) the completed petition for the minor, and 2) a copy of transcripts (unofficial transcripts are OK) showing your completed Astrophysics courses.<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.</li>

<p>The Department of Astronomy offers an undergraduate major and minor in Astrophysics. This major program prepares students for astrophysics graduate work or other advanced degrees in related fields, teaching, working in the field of computer applications, scientific and technical writing, a career as a field engineer, and other technical fields.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Information, including lists of required courses and forms to complete before declaring, <a href="http://astro.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-program/astrophysics-declaration">is available here</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>For honors in Astrophysics a student must fulfill the following additional requirements:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Maintain a grade point average of at least 3.5 in all courses in astronomy and related fields, and an overall grade point average of at least 3.3 in the University.</li>
	<li>Carry out an individual research or study project, involving at least 3 units of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASTRON%20H195" title="ASTRON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASTRON H195');">ASTRON H195</a></span>.</li>

</ol>

<p>The student's project is chosen in consultation with a departmental advisor, and the written report is judged by the student's research supervisor and by a departmental adviser.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Astronomy offers a minor program in Astrophysics. Students can work out the details by seeing the undergraduate major adviser in 501 Campbell Hall.</p>
<p>All the courses applied to the astrophysics minor must be taken for a letter grade. A minimum grade point average of 2.0 is required for the lower-division minor requirements as well as for the five upper-division courses used for the minor.  Only one upper-division class may overlap between your major and the Astrophysics Minor.</p>
<p>Once enrolled in the final course/courses to complete the Astrophysics Minor, students must complete the College of Letters and Science <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/minor.2019.pdf">Completion of L&amp;S Minor form</a>.</p>
<p>Turn in to the Undergraduate Adviser in 501 Campbell Hall: 1) the completed petition for the minor, and 2) a copy of transcripts (unofficial transcripts are OK) showing your completed Astrophysics courses.<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.</li>

A tour of the mysteries and inner workings of our solar system. What are planets made of? Why do they orbit the sun the way they do? How do planets form, and what are they made of? Why do some bizarre moons have oceans, volcanoes, and ice floes? What makes the Earth hospitable for life? Is the Earth a common type of planet or some cosmic quirk? This course will introduce basic physics, chemistry</span><span class="deschide">, and math to understand planets, moons, rings, comets, asteroids, atmospheres, and oceans. Understanding other worlds will help us save our own planet and help us understand our place in the universe. This course is web-based.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Department of Astronomy offers an undergraduate major and minor in Astrophysics. This major program prepares students for astrophysics graduate work or other advanced degrees in related fields, teaching, working in the field of computer applications, scientific and technical writing, a career as a field engineer, and other technical fields.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Information, including lists of required courses and forms to complete before declaring, <a href="http://astro.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-program/astrophysics-declaration">is available here</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>For honors in Astrophysics a student must fulfill the following additional requirements:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Maintain a grade point average of at least 3.5 in all courses in astronomy and related fields, and an overall grade point average of at least 3.3 in the University.</li>
	<li>Carry out an individual research or study project, involving at least 3 units of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASTRON%20H195" title="ASTRON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASTRON H195');">ASTRON H195</a></span>.</li>

</ol>

<p>The student's project is chosen in consultation with a departmental advisor, and the written report is judged by the student's research supervisor and by a departmental adviser.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Astronomy offers a minor program in Astrophysics. Students can work out the details by seeing the undergraduate major adviser in 501 Campbell Hall.</p>
<p>All the courses applied to the astrophysics minor must be taken for a letter grade. A minimum grade point average of 2.0 is required for the lower-division minor requirements as well as for the five upper-division courses used for the minor.  Only one upper-division class may overlap between your major and the Astrophysics Minor.</p>
<p>Once enrolled in the final course/courses to complete the Astrophysics Minor, students must complete the College of Letters and Science <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/minor.2019.pdf">Completion of L&amp;S Minor form</a>.</p>
<p>Turn in to the Undergraduate Adviser in 501 Campbell Hall: 1) the completed petition for the minor, and 2) a copy of transcripts (unofficial transcripts are OK) showing your completed Astrophysics courses.<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.</li>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Department of Astronomy offers an undergraduate major and minor in Astrophysics. This major program prepares students for astrophysics graduate work or other advanced degrees in related fields, teaching, working in the field of computer applications, scientific and technical writing, a career as a field engineer, and other technical fields.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Information, including lists of required courses and forms to complete before declaring, <a href="http://astro.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-program/astrophysics-declaration">is available here</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>For honors in Astrophysics a student must fulfill the following additional requirements:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Maintain a grade point average of at least 3.5 in all courses in astronomy and related fields, and an overall grade point average of at least 3.3 in the University.</li>
	<li>Carry out an individual research or study project, involving at least 3 units of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASTRON%20H195" title="ASTRON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASTRON H195');">ASTRON H195</a></span>.</li>

</ol>

<p>The student's project is chosen in consultation with a departmental advisor, and the written report is judged by the student's research supervisor and by a departmental adviser.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Astronomy offers a minor program in Astrophysics. Students can work out the details by seeing the undergraduate major adviser in 501 Campbell Hall.</p>
<p>All the courses applied to the astrophysics minor must be taken for a letter grade. A minimum grade point average of 2.0 is required for the lower-division minor requirements as well as for the five upper-division courses used for the minor.  Only one upper-division class may overlap between your major and the Astrophysics Minor.</p>
<p>Once enrolled in the final course/courses to complete the Astrophysics Minor, students must complete the College of Letters and Science <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/minor.2019.pdf">Completion of L&amp;S Minor form</a>.</p>
<p>Turn in to the Undergraduate Adviser in 501 Campbell Hall: 1) the completed petition for the minor, and 2) a copy of transcripts (unofficial transcripts are OK) showing your completed Astrophysics courses.<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.</li>

<p>The Department of Astronomy offers an undergraduate major and minor in Astrophysics. This major program prepares students for astrophysics graduate work or other advanced degrees in related fields, teaching, working in the field of computer applications, scientific and technical writing, a career as a field engineer, and other technical fields.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Information, including lists of required courses and forms to complete before declaring, <a href="http://astro.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate-program/astrophysics-declaration">is available here</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>For honors in Astrophysics a student must fulfill the following additional requirements:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Maintain a grade point average of at least 3.5 in all courses in astronomy and related fields, and an overall grade point average of at least 3.3 in the University.</li>
	<li>Carry out an individual research or study project, involving at least 3 units of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASTRON%20H195" title="ASTRON H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASTRON H195');">ASTRON H195</a></span>.</li>

</ol>

<p>The student's project is chosen in consultation with a departmental advisor, and the written report is judged by the student's research supervisor and by a departmental adviser.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Astronomy offers a minor program in Astrophysics. Students can work out the details by seeing the undergraduate major adviser in 501 Campbell Hall.</p>
<p>All the courses applied to the astrophysics minor must be taken for a letter grade. A minimum grade point average of 2.0 is required for the lower-division minor requirements as well as for the five upper-division courses used for the minor.  Only one upper-division class may overlap between your major and the Astrophysics Minor.</p>
<p>Once enrolled in the final course/courses to complete the Astrophysics Minor, students must complete the College of Letters and Science <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/minor.2019.pdf">Completion of L&amp;S Minor form</a>.</p>
<p>Turn in to the Undergraduate Adviser in 501 Campbell Hall: 1) the completed petition for the minor, and 2) a copy of transcripts (unofficial transcripts are OK) showing your completed Astrophysics courses.<br/>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.</li>

Why do some bizarre moons have oceans, volcanoes, and ice floes? What makes the Earth hospitable for life? Is the Earth a common type of planet or some cosmic quirk? This course will introduce basic physics, chemistry</span><span class="deschide">, and math to understand planets, moons, rings, comets, asteroids, atmospheres, and oceans. Understanding other worlds will help us save our own planet and help us understand our place in the universe. This course is web-based.</span><br/>
