				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p><strong>Note: The Asian Studies Major and all of the associated minors have been retired and folded into Global Studies.  We are no longer accepting Asian Studies declarations.  Please visit the</strong> <strong><a href="http://globalstudies.berkeley.edu/">Global Studies website</a></strong> <strong>or the</strong> <strong><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/global-studies/">Global Studies</a></strong> p<strong>age on the Berkeley Academic Guide for more information.</strong></p>
<p>The Undergraduate Group Major in Asian Studies is a rigorous but flexible interdisciplinary program designed to help students take advantage of the rich course offerings in the Asian field campus-wide in a way that is not available through individual departments. Utilizing the faculty and facilities of the entire university, these degree programs cut across conventional disciplinary lines and emphasize a basic core of knowledge concerning one particular geographic area of Asia. Within this core, which requires course work in multiple departments and reading knowledge of at least one Asian language, regionally-oriented students have the freedom to plan an individual program according to their particular interests and approaches. No two programs are alike, and students work closely with the Student Affairs Office and with a faculty mentor in designing their customized academic plan.</p>
<p>The Asian Studies: Multi-Area major program (denoted Area 1) is one of three major programs offered by the Group in Asian Studies. It includes all countries and regions of Asia. One of the areas chosen must be either China or Japan. Other areas can include Korea, countries in South Asia, or countries in Southeast Asia. <span>This major is for students who want to pursue a particular theme or topic of study with the coursework distributed across various countries or regions of Asia. Since this is an interdisciplinary major, the coursework will be distributed across departments as well.</span></p>
<p>A number of Asian Studies majors are double majors, finding the focus on Asia useful for complementing the political science, economics, anthropology, or history of art majors, for example.</p>
<p>For information regarding the other majors offered by the Group in Asian Studies, please see the relevant sections of this Guide:</p>
<p><a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/asian-studies-china/">Asian Studies: China</a> (Area 2)</p>
<p><a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/asian-studies-japan/">Asian Studies: Japan</a> (Area 3)</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>All required courses must be taken for a letter grade. After you have fulfilled the prerequisite courses listed on the Major Requirements tab, students will need to see the major adviser at the undergraduate office, 101 Stephens Hall, on Mondays and Wednesdays between 10 a.m. to noon and 1 to 4 p.m. The major adviser has the necessary paperwork needed to declare the major and put together an academic plan.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The honors thesis program provides an opportunity for eligible Asian Studies undergraduate seniors to complete original and independent research under the mentorship of a faculty thesis adviser. The honors thesis program is a year-long program which may begin in either the fall or spring semester of the senior year. It consists of the completion of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASIANST%20H195A" title="ASIANST H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASIANST H195A');">ASIANST H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ASIANST%20H195B" title="ASIANST H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ASIANST H195B');">ASIANST H195B</a></span> (3 units each, 6 units total), which includes the writing of the honors thesis. These can count towards two of the five concentration courses required for the major. These courses are independent study courses; there is no instruction or class time involved. All the work for the thesis and these two courses is done independently in consultation with faculty advisers. The honors thesis is expected to be a substantial research paper, both in its length and originality. Although there is no specific length requirement, a typical undergraduate honors thesis contains 40-80 pages of text, a bibliography, and often illustrations and tables. Each thesis is reviewed by two faculty members of your choice. To get a sense of what has been done in the past, visit <a href="http://ieas.berkeley.edu/gas/">our website</a> for a list of theses, or visit the undergraduate major adviser in 101 Stephens Hall for bound copies of theses.</p>

<p>Eligibility requirements for the honors program:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Overall UC grade point average (GPA) must be 3.5 or higher at the time of application and when beginning the thesis.</li>
	<li>Major GPA must be 3.6 or higher at the time of application and when beginning the thesis.</li>
	<li>Students must complete the language requirement, the upper division theories and methods, and history requirements, before embarking on the honors thesis.</li>
	<li>A completed honors thesis application form and a well-designed research proposal that has the sponsorship of two faculty members must be submitted to the undergraduate adviser.</li>
	<li>No Incompletes on record at the time of application and when beginning the thesis. All incomplete grades must be resolved before a student can submit the honors thesis form.</li>
</ol>
<p>Recommended application timeline for the honors program: </p>
<p>February of junior year (fall/spring thesis), or September of junior year (spring/fall thesis). Prepare brief thesis proposal and meet with prospective thesis adviser(s). Get the consent of a faculty member to serve as your sponsor. Discuss the project, appropriate methodology and research methods, and preparation of sample bibliography with the faculty sponsor. April of junior year (fall/spring); November of junior year (spring/fall): The thesis application form, signed by both the faculty adviser and second reader, due to the undergraduate major adviser in 101 Stephens Hall.</p>

<p>The <em>Berkeley Student Journal of Asian Studies</em> is an interdisciplinary student journal that bridges research at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The <em>Journal</em> strives to broaden the study of Asian across disciplinary lines and to expand the Asian Studies community by promoting leadership and scholarship of Asia. For information on submissions and to view copies of previous journals, please visit <a href="http://ieas.berkeley.edu/gas/sjas/" target="_blank">their website</a>.</p>
<h3>Study Abroad</h3>
<p>Opportunities to study in Asia are abundant and students are encouraged to take advantage of them. Those who qualify for the UC Education Abroad Programs (EAP) are often eligible for substantial scholarships. Many courses taken abroad transfer easily to the major. We accept up to 12 semester units for the major and two courses for the minor. Students should consult with the undergraduate major adviser for approval of courses taken through an education abroad program. For further information, contact the Berkeley Programs for Study Abroad at 160 Stephens Hall, 510-642-1356, and/or check out the <a href="http://eap.ucop.edu/Pages/index-new.html" target="_blank">EAP website</a> for the UC system. </p>
