				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Psychology as a scientific discipline aims to describe, understand, and predict the behavior of living organisms. In doing so, psychology embraces the many factors that influence behavior — from sensory experience to complex cognition, from the role of genetics to that of social and cultural environments, from the processes that explain behavior in early childhood to those that operate in older ages, and from normal development to pathological conditions. The Psychology Department at UC Berkeley reflects the diversity of our discipline's mission covering six key areas of research: Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience; Clinical Science; Cognition; Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental, and Social-Personality Psychology. Despite the existence of these specialization areas, the program learning goals focus on fostering methodological, statistical, and critical thinking skills that are not tied to any one particular content area in psychology but are relevant for all of them.</p>
<p>The major serves three purposes:</p>
<ol>
	<li>For the liberal arts student, the study of psychology provides an avenue for increased self-understanding and insight into the behavior of others. The objective study of behavior is one of the major themes of intellectual history in the last hundred-plus years.</li>
	<li>For students preparing for training in such professions as medicine, law, education and business, psychology provides important basic knowledge and principles.</li>
	<li>For students who plan on pursuing graduate work in psychology, the undergraduate major seeks to establish a sound foundation of research principles and knowledge of a variety of content areas.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Psychology is a capped (impacted) major at UC Berkeley. This means that due to high demand, the program, unfortunately, cannot accommodate every student who wishes to major in Psychology. As part of the terms of being a capped major, all students who apply to the major and meet the following criteria are guaranteed admission:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have a minimum 3.2 grade point average (GPA) in<em> </em>the <em>prerequisite</em> courses. (Note: GPA is not rounded up.)</li>
	<li>Students who entered UC Berkeley as a freshman must declare the major by their 5th semester <strong>OR</strong> prior to the accumulation of 80 semester units including work in progress (AP or college credit obtained in high school do not count towards the 80 units). Those who entered Berkeley as a junior-level transfer must declare the major no later than their first semester at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>Submit the application to the major by the posted deadline. Please refer to the department <a href="https://psychology.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-program/apply-major" target="_blank">website </a>for exact deadlines. </li>
</ol>
<p>If any of the above criteria are not met, students may still be admitted to the major. However, there is <em><strong>no guarantee</strong></em>. Please understand that applications will not be approved until all prerequisite courses are complete and final grades have been posted. This may mean that students will not technically be admitted to the major until the beginning of the following semester.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Declared Psychology major students may earn Honors or Highest Honors in the department for completion the Psychology Honors program. this requires submission of a thesis of high quality, based upon independent study under the supervision of a member of the Psychology Department's faculty, satisfactory completion of the required courses, and attaining the requisite GPAs at the time of graduation (3.5 in the Psychology major and 3.3 overall).</p>
<p>Students are <strong><em>required </em></strong>to complete the following courses, none of which count toward major requirements, with a letter grade:</p>
<ul>

To prepare for this, students must have a minimum of 2 units of UGIS 192 or Psych 199 on their transcript prior to applying for the honors program. It is recommended that students begin as a research assistant in their sophomore or junior year.</li>

<p>The Psychology Department at Berkeley reflects the diversity of the discipline's mission covering six key areas of research: Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience; Clinical Science; Cognition; Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental, and Social-Personality Psychology. Despite the existence of these specialization areas, the program learning goals focus on fostering methodological, statistical, and critical thinking skills that are not tied to any one particular content area in psychology but are relevant for all of them.</p>
<p>Most of the program level goals are introduced in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%201" title="PSYCH 1" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 1');">PSYCH 1</a></span> These goals are extended and reinforced in a majority of the core courses. These include <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20101" title="PSYCH 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 101');">PSYCH 101</a></span>, required of all majors, and the upper division Tier II courses that survey the major fields of psychology. There are several options to fulfill core coursework in each area and the following is a sampling of courses that fulfill the Tier II requirements: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20117" title="PSYCH 117" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 117');">PSYCH 117</a></span>; <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20C120" title="PSYCH C120" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH C120');">PSYCH C120</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20130" title="PSYCH 130" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 130');">PSYCH 130</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20140" title="PSYCH 140" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 140');">PSYCH 140</a></span> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20150" title="PSYCH 150" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 150');">PSYCH 150</a></span> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20160" title="PSYCH 160" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 160');">PSYCH 160</a></span>. The program is designed to ensure that all students gain broad exposure to the field of psychology. In addition, students are encouraged to develop a deeper understanding of at least one major content area in psychology.</p>

<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>1.    Understand basic concepts that characterize psychology as a field of scientific inquiry, and appreciate the various subfields that form the discipline as well as things that differentiate it from other related disciplines<br/>
2.    Develop an understanding of the central questions/issues in contemporary psychology as well as a historical perspective of psychological theories and key empirical data<br/>
3.    Develop a thorough understanding of one of the major content areas of psychology (i.e., Social/Personality, Developmental, Clinical, Cognitive, Biological)<br/>
4.    Develop skills to critically evaluate the presentation of scientific ideas and research in original scientific papers as well as in the popular media.<br/>
5.    Become familiar with research methods used in psychological research, and become proficient in basic concepts of statistical analyses and familiar with more advanced methods in data analyses and modeling<br/>
6.    Learn to develop, articulate, and communicate, both orally and in written form, a testable hypothesis, or an argument drawing from an existing body of literature.<br/>
7.    Apply a psychological principle to an everyday problem, or take an everyday problem and identify the relevant psychological mechanisms/issues</p>

The human brain is a complex information processing system and is currently the topic of multiple fascinating branches of research. Understanding how it works is a very challenging scientific task. In recent decades, multiple techniques for imaging the activity of the brain at work have been invented, which has allowed the field of cognitive neuroscience to flourish. Cognitive neuroscience is concerned with studying the neural mechanisms underlying various aspects</span><span class="deschide"> of cognition, by relating the activity in the brain to the tasks being performed by it. This typically requires exciting collaborations with other disciplines (e.g. psychology, biology, physics, computer science).</span><br/>

In this course, we examine the developmental trajectories that lead to mental illness in young children by: 1) understanding abnormal development in the context of normal development, and vice versa; 2) using a developmental approach to identify continuities and discontinuities; 3) addressing how mental illness develops and why; 4) learning the role genes and contexts of development play; 5) investigating multiple levels</span><span class="deschide">, and the dynamic reciprocal transactions among them; and 6) applying our knowledge to children’s real-world experiences, to better understand the mental illness, its mechanisms, and its challenges.</span><br/>

This lecture and small group activity course will examine the development of young children—from the prenatal period to age 8—in the varied contexts in which development occurs. The course is designed to introduce the basic theories and the research approaches that have been used to develop them.

We will discuss how this understanding may be different, depending on whether one has studied psychology, neuroscience, education, social welfare, public health, or public policy, and how each contributes to our deeper understanding of children’s healthy development.</span><br/>

The course will review research on culture, race, and ethnicity and will consider the implications of these findings for our understanding of race, culture, and ethnicity in American society. Mounting evidence suggests that psychological processes are culture-specific, theory-driven, and context-dependent. This course will focus on the effects that theories of mind, person</span><span class="deschide">, self, and social institutions have on human cognition, motivation, emotion, and social interactions in American society. Students will gain a better appreciation of the ways that cultural traditions and social practices regulate and transform psychological functioning.

Traditionally, research on prejudice and stereotyping has focused on the psychological mechanisms that lead people to be biased against others.

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Psychology as a scientific discipline aims to describe, understand, and predict the behavior of living organisms. In doing so, psychology embraces the many factors that influence behavior — from sensory experience to complex cognition, from the role of genetics to that of social and cultural environments, from the processes that explain behavior in early childhood to those that operate in older ages, and from normal development to pathological conditions. The Psychology Department at UC Berkeley reflects the diversity of our discipline's mission covering six key areas of research: Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience; Clinical Science; Cognition; Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental, and Social-Personality Psychology. Despite the existence of these specialization areas, the program learning goals focus on fostering methodological, statistical, and critical thinking skills that are not tied to any one particular content area in psychology but are relevant for all of them.</p>
<p>The major serves three purposes:</p>
<ol>
	<li>For the liberal arts student, the study of psychology provides an avenue for increased self-understanding and insight into the behavior of others. The objective study of behavior is one of the major themes of intellectual history in the last hundred-plus years.</li>
	<li>For students preparing for training in such professions as medicine, law, education and business, psychology provides important basic knowledge and principles.</li>
	<li>For students who plan on pursuing graduate work in psychology, the undergraduate major seeks to establish a sound foundation of research principles and knowledge of a variety of content areas.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Psychology is a capped (impacted) major at UC Berkeley. This means that due to high demand, the program, unfortunately, cannot accommodate every student who wishes to major in Psychology. As part of the terms of being a capped major, all students who apply to the major and meet the following criteria are guaranteed admission:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have a minimum 3.2 grade point average (GPA) in<em> </em>the <em>prerequisite</em> courses. (Note: GPA is not rounded up.)</li>
	<li>Students who entered UC Berkeley as a freshman must declare the major by their 5th semester <strong>OR</strong> prior to the accumulation of 80 semester units including work in progress (AP or college credit obtained in high school do not count towards the 80 units). Those who entered Berkeley as a junior-level transfer must declare the major no later than their first semester at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>Submit the application to the major by the posted deadline. Please refer to the department <a href="https://psychology.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-program/apply-major" target="_blank">website </a>for exact deadlines. </li>
</ol>
<p>If any of the above criteria are not met, students may still be admitted to the major. However, there is <em><strong>no guarantee</strong></em>. Please understand that applications will not be approved until all prerequisite courses are complete and final grades have been posted. This may mean that students will not technically be admitted to the major until the beginning of the following semester.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Declared Psychology major students may earn Honors or Highest Honors in the department for completion the Psychology Honors program. this requires submission of a thesis of high quality, based upon independent study under the supervision of a member of the Psychology Department's faculty, satisfactory completion of the required courses, and attaining the requisite GPAs at the time of graduation (3.5 in the Psychology major and 3.3 overall).</p>
<p>Students are <strong><em>required </em></strong>to complete the following courses, none of which count toward major requirements, with a letter grade:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=UGIS%20192B" title="UGIS 192B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'UGIS 192B');">UGIS 192B</a></span>  or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20199" title="PSYCH 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 199');">PSYCH 199</a></span>  Students applying to the honors program will be research apprentices in the laboratory of their intended faculty sponsors. To prepare for this, students must have a minimum of 2 units of UGIS 192 or Psych 199 on their transcript prior to applying for the honors program. It is recommended that students begin as a research assistant in their sophomore or junior year.</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Psychology Department at Berkeley reflects the diversity of the discipline's mission covering six key areas of research: Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience; Clinical Science; Cognition; Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental, and Social-Personality Psychology. Despite the existence of these specialization areas, the program learning goals focus on fostering methodological, statistical, and critical thinking skills that are not tied to any one particular content area in psychology but are relevant for all of them.</p>
<p>Most of the program level goals are introduced in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%201" title="PSYCH 1" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 1');">PSYCH 1</a></span> These goals are extended and reinforced in a majority of the core courses. These include <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20101" title="PSYCH 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 101');">PSYCH 101</a></span>, required of all majors, and the upper division Tier II courses that survey the major fields of psychology. There are several options to fulfill core coursework in each area and the following is a sampling of courses that fulfill the Tier II requirements: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20117" title="PSYCH 117" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 117');">PSYCH 117</a></span>; <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20C120" title="PSYCH C120" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH C120');">PSYCH C120</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20130" title="PSYCH 130" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 130');">PSYCH 130</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20140" title="PSYCH 140" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 140');">PSYCH 140</a></span> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20150" title="PSYCH 150" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 150');">PSYCH 150</a></span> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20160" title="PSYCH 160" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 160');">PSYCH 160</a></span>. The program is designed to ensure that all students gain broad exposure to the field of psychology. In addition, students are encouraged to develop a deeper understanding of at least one major content area in psychology.</p>

<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>1.    Understand basic concepts that characterize psychology as a field of scientific inquiry, and appreciate the various subfields that form the discipline as well as things that differentiate it from other related disciplines<br/>
2.    Develop an understanding of the central questions/issues in contemporary psychology as well as a historical perspective of psychological theories and key empirical data<br/>
3.    Develop a thorough understanding of one of the major content areas of psychology (i.e., Social/Personality, Developmental, Clinical, Cognitive, Biological)<br/>
4.    Develop skills to critically evaluate the presentation of scientific ideas and research in original scientific papers as well as in the popular media.<br/>
5.    Become familiar with research methods used in psychological research, and become proficient in basic concepts of statistical analyses and familiar with more advanced methods in data analyses and modeling<br/>
6.    Learn to develop, articulate, and communicate, both orally and in written form, a testable hypothesis, or an argument drawing from an existing body of literature.<br/>
7.    Apply a psychological principle to an everyday problem, or take an everyday problem and identify the relevant psychological mechanisms/issues</p>

The human brain is a complex information processing system and is currently the topic of multiple fascinating branches of research. Understanding how it works is a very challenging scientific task. In recent decades, multiple techniques for imaging the activity of the brain at work have been invented, which has allowed the field of cognitive neuroscience to flourish. Cognitive neuroscience is concerned with studying the neural mechanisms underlying various aspects</span><span class="deschide"> of cognition, by relating the activity in the brain to the tasks being performed by it. This typically requires exciting collaborations with other disciplines (e.g. psychology, biology, physics, computer science).</span><br/>

In this course, we examine the developmental trajectories that lead to mental illness in young children by: 1) understanding abnormal development in the context of normal development, and vice versa; 2) using a developmental approach to identify continuities and discontinuities; 3) addressing how mental illness develops and why; 4) learning the role genes and contexts of development play; 5) investigating multiple levels</span><span class="deschide">, and the dynamic reciprocal transactions among them; and 6) applying our knowledge to children’s real-world experiences, to better understand the mental illness, its mechanisms, and its challenges.</span><br/>

Global mental health seeks to alleviate suffering caused by mental disorders globally. Although most of the world lives in low-and-middle income countries, the majority of mental health resources are concentrated in high-income countries. Therefore, we focus on the mental health burden in low-resource settings. Through primary articles and recent chapters, this course integrates the scientific evidence, cultural</span><span class="deschide"> and contextual nuances, and interdisciplinary approaches of global mental health.</span><br/>

This lecture and small group activity course will examine the development of young children—from the prenatal period to age 8—in the varied contexts in which development occurs. The course is designed to introduce the basic theories and the research approaches that have been used to develop them. We will also explore how the contexts, the influences of environments in which children are growing and</span><span class="deschide"> living, affect their development and our understanding of children. We will discuss how this understanding may be different, depending on whether one has studied psychology, neuroscience, education, social welfare, public health, or public policy, and how each contributes to our deeper understanding of children’s healthy development.</span><br/>

This course will teach a human-centered, evidence-based method for finding new ways to solve persistent problems: Design Thinking. Design Thinking is a methodology for collaborative problem solving pioneered at the design firm IDEO and Stanford University to come up with game-changing solutions to difficult problems. As student learners accustomed to taking others’ perspectives and problem solving, we are especially well-suited to use Design</span><span class="deschide"> Thinking.<br/>
We will be tackling the problem of children’s school readiness. The goal of this class is to find imaginative and practical solutions -- imaginative enough to be exciting and effective for children and families, and practical enough to be able to pilot these solutions during the class.<br/></span><br/>

This seminar examines how the diverse policy contexts in which children are born and raised have dramatic implications for their life trajectories. We will explore how, when and why government intervenes in children’s lives, through family, pre-/school, community, and digital media contexts, aiming to improve their developmental trajectories. From this basis, we investigate the effects of policies on children locally, nationally,</span><span class="deschide"> and internationally. Drawing from a variety of case studies and empirical research, students will gain a deep understanding of policy goals, development, implementation, and implications. After gaining familiarity with early childhood policies, students will develop their own early childhood policy.</span><br/>

Mounting evidence suggests that psychological processes are culture-specific, theory-driven, and context-dependent. This course will focus on the effects that theories of mind, person</span><span class="deschide">, self, and social institutions have on human cognition, motivation, emotion, and social interactions in American society. Students will gain a better appreciation of the ways that cultural traditions and social practices regulate and transform psychological functioning. Simply, the course is about how culture affects psyche and how psyche affects culture.</span><br/>

Traditionally, research on prejudice and stereotyping has focused on the psychological mechanisms that lead people to be biased against others. Recent research has begun to shed light on the psychological legacy of prejudice and stereotyping for their targets. This course will review the major contributions of each of these literatures, providing students with a broad understanding of both classic and</span><span class="deschide"> current issues in the field. The course will be divided into three sections: bias (i.e., the perpetrator's perspective), stigma (i.e., the target's perspective), and intergroup relations.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Psychology as a scientific discipline aims to describe, understand, and predict the behavior of living organisms. In doing so, psychology embraces the many factors that influence behavior — from sensory experience to complex cognition, from the role of genetics to that of social and cultural environments, from the processes that explain behavior in early childhood to those that operate in older ages, and from normal development to pathological conditions. The Psychology Department at UC Berkeley reflects the diversity of our discipline's mission covering six key areas of research: Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience; Clinical Science; Cognition; Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental, and Social-Personality Psychology. Despite the existence of these specialization areas, the program learning goals focus on fostering methodological, statistical, and critical thinking skills that are not tied to any one particular content area in psychology but are relevant for all of them.</p>
<p>The major serves three purposes:</p>
<ol>
	<li>For the liberal arts student, the study of psychology provides an avenue for increased self-understanding and insight into the behavior of others. The objective study of behavior is one of the major themes of intellectual history in the last hundred-plus years.</li>
	<li>For students preparing for training in such professions as medicine, law, education and business, psychology provides important basic knowledge and principles.</li>
	<li>For students who plan on pursuing graduate work in psychology, the undergraduate major seeks to establish a sound foundation of research principles and knowledge of a variety of content areas.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Psychology is a capped (impacted) major at UC Berkeley. This means that due to high demand, the program, unfortunately, cannot accommodate every student who wishes to major in Psychology. As part of the terms of being a capped major, all students who apply to the major and meet the following criteria are guaranteed admission:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have a minimum 3.2 grade point average (GPA) in<em> </em>the <em>prerequisite</em> courses. (Note: GPA is not rounded up.)</li>
	<li>Students who entered UC Berkeley as a freshman must declare the major by their 5th semester <strong>OR</strong> prior to the accumulation of 80 semester units including work in progress (AP or college credit obtained in high school do not count towards the 80 units). Those who entered Berkeley as a junior-level transfer must declare the major no later than their first semester at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>Submit the application to the major by the posted deadline. Please refer to the department <a href="https://psychology.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-program/apply-major" target="_blank">website </a>for exact deadlines. </li>
</ol>
<p>If any of the above criteria are not met, students may still be admitted to the major. However, there is <em><strong>no guarantee</strong></em>. Please understand that applications will not be approved until all prerequisite courses are complete and final grades have been posted. This may mean that students will not technically be admitted to the major until the beginning of the following semester.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Declared Psychology major students may earn Honors or Highest Honors in the department for completion the Psychology Honors program. this requires submission of a thesis of high quality, based upon independent study under the supervision of a member of the Psychology Department's faculty, satisfactory completion of the required courses, and attaining the requisite GPAs at the time of graduation (3.5 in the Psychology major and 3.3 overall).</p>
<p>Students are <strong><em>required </em></strong>to complete the following courses, none of which count toward major requirements, with a letter grade:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=UGIS%20192B" title="UGIS 192B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'UGIS 192B');">UGIS 192B</a></span>  or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20199" title="PSYCH 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 199');">PSYCH 199</a></span>  Students applying to the honors program will be research apprentices in the laboratory of their intended faculty sponsors. To prepare for this, students must have a minimum of 2 units of UGIS 192 or Psych 199 on their transcript prior to applying for the honors program. It is recommended that students begin as a research assistant in their sophomore or junior year.</li>

<p>The Psychology Department at Berkeley reflects the diversity of the discipline's mission covering six key areas of research: Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience; Clinical Science; Cognition; Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental, and Social-Personality Psychology. Despite the existence of these specialization areas, the program learning goals focus on fostering methodological, statistical, and critical thinking skills that are not tied to any one particular content area in psychology but are relevant for all of them.</p>
<p>Most of the program level goals are introduced in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%201" title="PSYCH 1" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 1');">PSYCH 1</a></span> These goals are extended and reinforced in a majority of the core courses. These include <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20101" title="PSYCH 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 101');">PSYCH 101</a></span>, required of all majors, and the upper division Tier II courses that survey the major fields of psychology. There are several options to fulfill core coursework in each area and the following is a sampling of courses that fulfill the Tier II requirements: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20117" title="PSYCH 117" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 117');">PSYCH 117</a></span>; <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20C120" title="PSYCH C120" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH C120');">PSYCH C120</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20130" title="PSYCH 130" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 130');">PSYCH 130</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20140" title="PSYCH 140" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 140');">PSYCH 140</a></span> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20150" title="PSYCH 150" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 150');">PSYCH 150</a></span> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20160" title="PSYCH 160" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 160');">PSYCH 160</a></span>. The program is designed to ensure that all students gain broad exposure to the field of psychology. In addition, students are encouraged to develop a deeper understanding of at least one major content area in psychology.</p>

<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>1.    Understand basic concepts that characterize psychology as a field of scientific inquiry, and appreciate the various subfields that form the discipline as well as things that differentiate it from other related disciplines<br/>
2.    Develop an understanding of the central questions/issues in contemporary psychology as well as a historical perspective of psychological theories and key empirical data<br/>
3.    Develop a thorough understanding of one of the major content areas of psychology (i.e., Social/Personality, Developmental, Clinical, Cognitive, Biological)<br/>
4.    Develop skills to critically evaluate the presentation of scientific ideas and research in original scientific papers as well as in the popular media.<br/>
5.    Become familiar with research methods used in psychological research, and become proficient in basic concepts of statistical analyses and familiar with more advanced methods in data analyses and modeling<br/>
6.    Learn to develop, articulate, and communicate, both orally and in written form, a testable hypothesis, or an argument drawing from an existing body of literature.<br/>
7.    Apply a psychological principle to an everyday problem, or take an everyday problem and identify the relevant psychological mechanisms/issues</p>

The human brain is a complex information processing system and is currently the topic of multiple fascinating branches of research. Understanding how it works is a very challenging scientific task. In recent decades, multiple techniques for imaging the activity of the brain at work have been invented, which has allowed the field of cognitive neuroscience to flourish. Cognitive neuroscience is concerned with studying the neural mechanisms underlying various aspects</span><span class="deschide"> of cognition, by relating the activity in the brain to the tasks being performed by it. This typically requires exciting collaborations with other disciplines (e.g. psychology, biology, physics, computer science).</span><br/>

This course provides a comprehensive overview of behavorial endocrinology beginning with hormone production and actions on target issues and continuing with an exploration of a variety of behaviors and their hormonal regulation/consequences. The course uses a comparative approach to examine the reciprocal interactions between the neuroendocrine system and behavior, considering the effects of hormone on development and adult behavior in addition</span><span class="deschide"> to how behavior regulates endocrine physiology. While much of the course focuses on non-human vertebrate species, the relevance to humans is explored where appropriate. Topics include sexual differentiation and sex differences in behavior, reproductive, parental, and aggressive behaviors, and hormonal and behavioral homeostatic regulation.</span><br/>

Coverage of serious mental illness with adequate and disseminable intervention strategies is all too limited. Hence, there is a great need for the next generation of clinical scientists to contribute to the mission of treatment development for</span><span class="deschide"> mental illness. In this course we will learn about, and critique, models of psychotherapy. We will review the steps in treatment development spanning from the study of mechanisms on to proof of concept and to establishing the feasibility of novel treatment ideas.</span><br/>

This lecture and small group activity course will examine the development of young children—from the prenatal period to age 8—in the varied contexts in which development occurs. The course is designed to introduce the basic theories and the research approaches that have been used to develop them. We will also explore how the contexts, the influences of environments in which children are growing and</span><span class="deschide"> living, affect their development and our understanding of children. We will discuss how this understanding may be different, depending on whether one has studied psychology, neuroscience, education, social welfare, public health, or public policy, and how each contributes to our deeper understanding of children’s healthy development.</span><br/>

This seminar will examine the developmental context of young children—from the prenatal period to age 8. The course is designed to introduce research on how individual, family, pre-/school, community, and digital media contexts influence children’s development and learning. We will discuss how this understanding may be different, depending on whether one has studied psychology, neuroscience, education, social welfare, public health</span><span class="deschide">, or public policy, and how each contributes to our deeper understanding of children’s healthy development.<br/></span><br/>

This seminar examines how the diverse policy contexts in which children are born and raised have dramatic implications for their life trajectories. We will explore how, when and why government intervenes in children’s lives, through family, pre-/school, community, and digital media contexts, aiming to improve their developmental trajectories. From this basis, we investigate the effects of policies on children locally, nationally,</span><span class="deschide"> and internationally. Drawing from a variety of case studies and empirical research, students will gain a deep understanding of policy goals, development, implementation, and implications. After gaining familiarity with early childhood policies, students will develop their own early childhood policy.</span><br/>

We will first review the different treatments of happiness in the world’s philosophical traditions: conceptions of the good life in classical Greek and Judeo-Christian thought, the great East Asian philosophies, and ideas about happiness that emerged in the age of Enlightenment. With these different perspectives as a framework, the</span><span class="deschide"> course will turn to treatments of happiness in the behavioral sciences, evolutionary scholarship, and neuroscience. Special Emphasis will be given to understanding how happiness arises in experiences of the moral emotions, including gratitude, compassion, reverence and awe, and aesthetic emotions like humor and beauty.</span><br/>

The course will review research on culture, race, and ethnicity and will consider the implications of these findings for our understanding of race, culture, and ethnicity in American society. Mounting evidence suggests that psychological processes are culture-specific, theory-driven, and context-dependent. This course will focus on the effects that theories of mind, person</span><span class="deschide">, self, and social institutions have on human cognition, motivation, emotion, and social interactions in American society. Students will gain a better appreciation of the ways that cultural traditions and social practices regulate and transform psychological functioning.

Traditionally, research on prejudice and stereotyping has focused on the psychological mechanisms that lead people to be biased against others.

<p>Psychology as a scientific discipline aims to describe, understand, and predict the behavior of living organisms. In doing so, psychology embraces the many factors that influence behavior — from sensory experience to complex cognition, from the role of genetics to that of social and cultural environments, from the processes that explain behavior in early childhood to those that operate in older ages, and from normal development to pathological conditions. The Psychology Department at UC Berkeley reflects the diversity of our discipline's mission covering six key areas of research: Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience; Clinical Science; Cognition; Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental, and Social-Personality Psychology. Despite the existence of these specialization areas, the program learning goals focus on fostering methodological, statistical, and critical thinking skills that are not tied to any one particular content area in psychology but are relevant for all of them.</p>
<p>The major serves three purposes:</p>
<ol>
	<li>For the liberal arts student, the study of psychology provides an avenue for increased self-understanding and insight into the behavior of others. The objective study of behavior is one of the major themes of intellectual history in the last hundred-plus years.</li>
	<li>For students preparing for training in such professions as medicine, law, education and business, psychology provides important basic knowledge and principles.</li>
	<li>For students who plan on pursuing graduate work in psychology, the undergraduate major seeks to establish a sound foundation of research principles and knowledge of a variety of content areas.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Psychology is a capped (impacted) major at UC Berkeley. This means that due to high demand, the program, unfortunately, cannot accommodate every student who wishes to major in Psychology. As part of the terms of being a capped major, all students who apply to the major and meet the following criteria are guaranteed admission:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have a minimum 3.2 grade point average (GPA) in<em> </em>the <em>prerequisite</em> courses. (Note: GPA is not rounded up.)</li>
	<li>Students who entered UC Berkeley as a freshman must declare the major by their 5th semester <strong>OR</strong> prior to the accumulation of 80 semester units including work in progress (AP or college credit obtained in high school do not count towards the 80 units). Those who entered Berkeley as a junior-level transfer must declare the major no later than their first semester at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>Submit the application to the major by the posted deadline. Please refer to the department <a href="https://psychology.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-program/apply-major" target="_blank">website </a>for exact deadlines. </li>
</ol>
<p>If any of the above criteria are not met, students may still be admitted to the major. However, there is <em><strong>no guarantee</strong></em>. Please understand that applications will not be approved until all prerequisite courses are complete and final grades have been posted. This may mean that students will not technically be admitted to the major until the beginning of the following semester.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Declared Psychology major students may earn Honors or Highest Honors in the department for completion the Psychology Honors program. this requires submission of a thesis of high quality, based upon independent study under the supervision of a member of the Psychology Department's faculty, satisfactory completion of the required courses, and attaining the requisite GPAs at the time of graduation (3.5 in the Psychology major and 3.3 overall).</p>
<p>Students are <strong><em>required </em></strong>to complete the following courses, none of which count toward major requirements, with a letter grade:</p>

The human brain is a complex information processing system and is currently the topic of multiple fascinating branches of research. Understanding how it works is a very challenging scientific task. In recent decades, multiple techniques for imaging the activity of the brain at work have been invented, which has allowed the field of cognitive neuroscience to flourish. Cognitive neuroscience is concerned with studying the neural mechanisms underlying various aspects</span><span class="deschide"> of cognition, by relating the activity in the brain to the tasks being performed by it. This typically requires exciting collaborations with other disciplines (e.g. psychology, biology, physics, computer science).</span><br/>

The biology of learning and neural plasticity is critical to our understanding of development, culture, behavioral change, uniqueness of individuals, and limits to an organism’s potential. We will study experimental investigations of behavior and neurobiology at the cellular and circuit level to get a basic introduction to what is known and unknown about learning and neural plasticity. Topics may include associative learning, habit formation</span><span class="deschide">, fear, memory systems, neurons, synapses, dendritic spines and axonal boutons, LTP, and adult neurogenesis. We will discuss these topics in the context of normal development and disease. Students will become familiar with thinking about the brain at the level of circuits, cells, synapses, and proteins.</span><br/>

This course provides a comprehensive overview of behavorial endocrinology beginning with hormone production and actions on target issues and continuing with an exploration of a variety of behaviors and their hormonal regulation/consequences. The course uses a comparative approach to examine the reciprocal interactions between the neuroendocrine system and behavior, considering the effects of hormone on development and adult behavior in addition</span><span class="deschide"> to how behavior regulates endocrine physiology. While much of the course focuses on non-human vertebrate species, the relevance to humans is explored where appropriate. Topics include sexual differentiation and sex differences in behavior, reproductive, parental, and aggressive behaviors, and hormonal and behavioral homeostatic regulation.</span><br/>

What are the changes in brain structure and function that underlie improvements in cognitive abilities over childhood and adolescence? Or, coming from a different perspective, what insights can we gain regarding the neural basis of cognition by examining how the brain develops? And how are such findings relevant for medicine, education, and the law? The cutting-edge new field of developmental cognitive neuroscience is beginning to address these</span><span class="deschide"> and other questions. This course will consititute an overview of current research and methods in this field, focusing on both typically and atypically developing children and adolescents.

This lecture and small group activity course will examine the development of young children—from the prenatal period to age 8—in the varied contexts in which development occurs. The course is designed to introduce the basic theories and the research approaches that have been used to develop them. We will also explore how the contexts, the influences of environments in which children are growing and</span><span class="deschide"> living, affect their development and our understanding of children. We will discuss how this understanding may be different, depending on whether one has studied psychology, neuroscience, education, social welfare, public health, or public policy, and how each contributes to our deeper understanding of children’s healthy development.</span><br/>

This seminar examines how the diverse policy contexts in which children are born and raised have dramatic implications for their life trajectories. We will explore how, when and why government intervenes in children’s lives, through family, pre-/school, community, and digital media contexts, aiming to improve their developmental trajectories. From this basis, we investigate the effects of policies on children locally, nationally,</span><span class="deschide"> and internationally. Drawing from a variety of case studies and empirical research, students will gain a deep understanding of policy goals, development, implementation, and implications.

The course will review research on culture, race, and ethnicity and will consider the implications of these findings for our understanding of race, culture, and ethnicity in American society. Mounting evidence suggests that psychological processes are culture-specific, theory-driven, and context-dependent. This course will focus on the effects that theories of mind, person</span><span class="deschide">, self, and social institutions have on human cognition, motivation, emotion, and social interactions in American society. Students will gain a better appreciation of the ways that cultural traditions and social practices regulate and transform psychological functioning.

The Psychology Post Baccalaureate Program at UC Berkeley is intended to serve as a training program for students who have interest in pursuing graduate degrees in Psychology but who are lacking necessary academic training and research experience. In addition to the required course and lab work, Post Baccalaureate students are required to complete a two-part research learning project, called The Capstone Experience. The Capstone Experience consists</span><span class="deschide"> of two components: an applied written submission and a formal research presentation.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Psychology as a scientific discipline aims to describe, understand, and predict the behavior of living organisms. In doing so, psychology embraces the many factors that influence behavior — from sensory experience to complex cognition, from the role of genetics to that of social and cultural environments, from the processes that explain behavior in early childhood to those that operate in older ages, and from normal development to pathological conditions. The Psychology Department at UC Berkeley reflects the diversity of our discipline's mission covering six key areas of research: Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience; Clinical Science; Cognition; Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental, and Social-Personality Psychology. Despite the existence of these specialization areas, the program learning goals focus on fostering methodological, statistical, and critical thinking skills that are not tied to any one particular content area in psychology but are relevant for all of them.</p>
<p>The major serves three purposes:</p>
<ol>
	<li>For the liberal arts student, the study of psychology provides an avenue for increased self-understanding and insight into the behavior of others. The objective study of behavior is one of the major themes of intellectual history in the last hundred-plus years.</li>
	<li>For students preparing for training in such professions as medicine, law, education and business, psychology provides important basic knowledge and principles.</li>
	<li>For students who plan on pursuing graduate work in psychology, the undergraduate major seeks to establish a sound foundation of research principles and knowledge of a variety of content areas.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Psychology is a capped (impacted) major at UC Berkeley. This means that due to high demand, the program, unfortunately, cannot accommodate every student who wishes to major in Psychology. As part of the terms of being a capped major, all students who apply to the major and meet the following criteria are guaranteed admission:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have a minimum 3.2 grade point average (GPA) in<em> </em>the <em>prerequisite</em> courses. (Note: GPA is not rounded up.)</li>
	<li>Students who entered UC Berkeley as a freshman must declare the major by their 5th semester <strong>OR</strong> prior to the accumulation of 80 semester units including work in progress (AP or college credit obtained in high school do not count towards the 80 units). Those who entered Berkeley as a junior-level transfer must declare the major no later than their first semester at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>Submit the application to the major by the posted deadline. Please refer to the department <a href="https://psychology.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-program/apply-major" target="_blank">website </a>for exact deadlines. </li>
</ol>
<p>If any of the above criteria are not met, students may still be admitted to the major. However, there is <em><strong>no guarantee</strong></em>. Please understand that applications will not be approved until all prerequisite courses are complete and final grades have been posted. This may mean that students will not technically be admitted to the major until the beginning of the following semester.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Declared Psychology major students may earn Honors or Highest Honors in the department for completion the Psychology Honors program. this requires submission of a thesis of high quality, based upon independent study under the supervision of a member of the Psychology Department's faculty, satisfactory completion of the required courses, and attaining the requisite GPAs at the time of graduation (3.5 in the Psychology major and 3.3 overall).</p>
<p>Students are <strong><em>required </em></strong>to complete the following courses, none of which count toward major requirements, with a letter grade:</p>
<ul>

To prepare for this, students must have a minimum of 2 units of UGIS 192 or Psych 199 on their transcript prior to applying for the honors program. It is recommended that students begin as a research assistant in their sophomore or junior year.</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Psychology Department at Berkeley reflects the diversity of the discipline's mission covering six key areas of research: Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience; Clinical Science; Cognition; Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental, and Social-Personality Psychology. Despite the existence of these specialization areas, the program learning goals focus on fostering methodological, statistical, and critical thinking skills that are not tied to any one particular content area in psychology but are relevant for all of them.</p>
<p>Most of the program level goals are introduced in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%201" title="PSYCH 1" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 1');">PSYCH 1</a></span> These goals are extended and reinforced in a majority of the core courses. These include <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20101" title="PSYCH 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 101');">PSYCH 101</a></span>, required of all majors, and the upper division Tier II courses that survey the major fields of psychology. There are several options to fulfill core coursework in each area and the following is a sampling of courses that fulfill the Tier II requirements: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20117" title="PSYCH 117" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 117');">PSYCH 117</a></span>; <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20C120" title="PSYCH C120" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH C120');">PSYCH C120</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20130" title="PSYCH 130" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 130');">PSYCH 130</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20140" title="PSYCH 140" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 140');">PSYCH 140</a></span> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20150" title="PSYCH 150" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 150');">PSYCH 150</a></span> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20160" title="PSYCH 160" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 160');">PSYCH 160</a></span>. The program is designed to ensure that all students gain broad exposure to the field of psychology. In addition, students are encouraged to develop a deeper understanding of at least one major content area in psychology.</p>

<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>1.    Understand basic concepts that characterize psychology as a field of scientific inquiry, and appreciate the various subfields that form the discipline as well as things that differentiate it from other related disciplines<br/>
2.    Develop an understanding of the central questions/issues in contemporary psychology as well as a historical perspective of psychological theories and key empirical data<br/>
3.    Develop a thorough understanding of one of the major content areas of psychology (i.e., Social/Personality, Developmental, Clinical, Cognitive, Biological)<br/>
4.    Develop skills to critically evaluate the presentation of scientific ideas and research in original scientific papers as well as in the popular media.<br/>
5.    Become familiar with research methods used in psychological research, and become proficient in basic concepts of statistical analyses and familiar with more advanced methods in data analyses and modeling<br/>
6.    Learn to develop, articulate, and communicate, both orally and in written form, a testable hypothesis, or an argument drawing from an existing body of literature.<br/>
7.    Apply a psychological principle to an everyday problem, or take an everyday problem and identify the relevant psychological mechanisms/issues</p>

The human brain is a complex information processing system and is currently the topic of multiple fascinating branches of research. Understanding how it works is a very challenging scientific task. In recent decades, multiple techniques for imaging the activity of the brain at work have been invented, which has allowed the field of cognitive neuroscience to flourish. Cognitive neuroscience is concerned with studying the neural mechanisms underlying various aspects</span><span class="deschide"> of cognition, by relating the activity in the brain to the tasks being performed by it. This typically requires exciting collaborations with other disciplines (e.g. psychology, biology, physics, computer science).</span><br/>

In this course, we examine the developmental trajectories that lead to mental illness in young children by: 1) understanding abnormal development in the context of normal development, and vice versa; 2) using a developmental approach to identify continuities and discontinuities; 3) addressing how mental illness develops and why; 4) learning the role genes and contexts of development play; 5) investigating multiple levels</span><span class="deschide">, and the dynamic reciprocal transactions among them; and 6) applying our knowledge to children’s real-world experiences, to better understand the mental illness, its mechanisms, and its challenges.</span><br/>

This lecture and small group activity course will examine the development of young children—from the prenatal period to age 8—in the varied contexts in which development occurs. The course is designed to introduce the basic theories and the research approaches that have been used to develop them.

We will discuss how this understanding may be different, depending on whether one has studied psychology, neuroscience, education, social welfare, public health, or public policy, and how each contributes to our deeper understanding of children’s healthy development.</span><br/>

The course will review research on culture, race, and ethnicity and will consider the implications of these findings for our understanding of race, culture, and ethnicity in American society. Mounting evidence suggests that psychological processes are culture-specific, theory-driven, and context-dependent. This course will focus on the effects that theories of mind, person</span><span class="deschide">, self, and social institutions have on human cognition, motivation, emotion, and social interactions in American society. Students will gain a better appreciation of the ways that cultural traditions and social practices regulate and transform psychological functioning.

Traditionally, research on prejudice and stereotyping has focused on the psychological mechanisms that lead people to be biased against others.
