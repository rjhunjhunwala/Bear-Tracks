				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Operations Research and Management Science (ORMS) major is designed for students in the College of Letters &amp; Science. It provides a solid foundation in the quantitative, model building, and problem-solving skills of operations research and management science. It also gives students the flexibility to learn more about a particular field of interest to them in which they can apply these skills.</p>
<p>The major is very math intensive and is appropriate for students who enjoy and are good at mathematics, computers, and solving practical, multidisciplinary problems. </p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students can declare a major after they have completed at least one semester at UC Berkeley. The ORMS major is impacted. To be considered for admission, students should have a minimum of a 3.2 overall grade point average (GPA) in the prerequisite courses. Applications must be submitted by invitation only. To be considered for invitation, request to be added to the waiting list by contacting Anayancy Paz, 4145 Etcheverry Hall, <a href="mailto:anayancy@berkeley.edu">anayancy@berkeley.edu</a>. The program plan cannot be approved if students will have completed more than 80 semester units prior to their last intended semester (AP units do not count towards this 80-unit ceiling).</p>
<p>All four prerequisite classes (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MATH%2053" title="MATH 53" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 53');">MATH 53</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MATH%2054" title="MATH 54" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 54');">MATH 54</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ECON%201" title="ECON 1" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ECON 1');">ECON 1</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ECON%202" title="ECON 2" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ECON 2');">ECON 2</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ECON%20C3" title="ECON C3" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ECON C3');">ECON C3</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=UGBA%2010" title="UGBA 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'UGBA 10');">UGBA 10</a></span>) must be completed prior to acceptance to the major and all must be taken for a letter grade. Transfer students should apply at the end of their first semester at Berkeley. Admissions decisions will not be made until any prerequisite courses in progress are finished, and grades are available.</p>

<p>Many factors are considered in determining admission. The main criterion is academic performance as measured by the Berkeley GPA in the prerequisite courses. </p>
<p><span>Since this major is capped, it is a good idea to have a backup plan. There is an Operations Research concentration in the Math Department that might be a good choice if students are not admitted to the ORMS major.</span></p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with a grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.5 overall and 3.7 in the major should consider participating in the ORMS honors program. To graduate with honors, a student must find a faculty sponsor appropriate for an original research project that he or she wishes to do and enroll in two semesters (6 units) of the honors thesis course.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a student may take two approved graduate courses in Operations Research or a related field, and achieve at least an A- in each course. Courses used for the honors program cannot be used to fulfill the requirements for IEOR graduate programs. The student must also maintain a minimum 3.5 overall GPA and 3.7 in the major.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Operations Research and Management Science.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://ieor.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a <em>Pass/No Pass </em>basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs, with the exception of minors offered outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>
</ol>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Operations Research and Management Science (ORMS) major is designed for students in the College of Letters &amp; Science. It provides a solid foundation in the quantitative, model building, and problem-solving skills of operations research and management science. It also gives students the flexibility to learn more about a particular field of interest to them in which they can apply these skills.</p>
<p>The major is very math intensive and is appropriate for students who enjoy and are good at mathematics, computers, and solving practical, multidisciplinary problems. </p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students can declare a major after they have completed at least one semester at UC Berkeley. The ORMS major is impacted. To be considered for admission, students should have a minimum of a 3.2 overall grade point average (GPA) in the prerequisite courses. Applications must be submitted by invitation only. To be considered for invitation, request to be added to the waiting list by contacting Anayancy Paz, 4145 Etcheverry Hall, <a href="mailto:anayancy@berkeley.edu">anayancy@berkeley.edu</a>. The program plan cannot be approved if students will have completed more than 80 semester units prior to their last intended semester (AP units do not count towards this 80-unit ceiling).</p>
<p>All four prerequisite classes (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MATH%2053" title="MATH 53" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 53');">MATH 53</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MATH%2054" title="MATH 54" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 54');">MATH 54</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ECON%201" title="ECON 1" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ECON 1');">ECON 1</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ECON%202" title="ECON 2" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ECON 2');">ECON 2</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ECON%20C3" title="ECON C3" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ECON C3');">ECON C3</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=UGBA%2010" title="UGBA 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'UGBA 10');">UGBA 10</a></span>) must be completed prior to acceptance to the major and all must be taken for a letter grade. Transfer students should apply at the end of their first semester at Berkeley. Admissions decisions will not be made until any prerequisite courses in progress are finished, and grades are available.</p>

<p>Many factors are considered in determining admission. The main criterion is academic performance as measured by the Berkeley GPA in the prerequisite courses. </p>
<p><span>Since this major is capped, it is a good idea to have a backup plan. There is an Operations Research concentration in the Math Department that might be a good choice if students are not admitted to the ORMS major.</span></p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with a grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.5 overall and 3.7 in the major should consider participating in the ORMS honors program. To graduate with honors, a student must find a faculty sponsor appropriate for an original research project that he or she wishes to do and enroll in two semesters (6 units) of the honors thesis course.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a student may take two approved graduate courses in Operations Research or a related field, and achieve at least an A- in each course. Courses used for the honors program cannot be used to fulfill the requirements for IEOR graduate programs. The student must also maintain a minimum 3.5 overall GPA and 3.7 in the major.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Operations Research and Management Science.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://ieor.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Operations Research and Management Science (ORMS) major is designed for students in the College of Letters &amp; Science. It provides a solid foundation in the quantitative, model building, and problem-solving skills of operations research and management science. It also gives students the flexibility to learn more about a particular field of interest to them in which they can apply these skills.</p>
<p>The major is very math intensive and is appropriate for students who enjoy and are good at mathematics, computers, and solving practical, multidisciplinary problems. </p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students can declare a major after they have completed at least one semester at UC Berkeley. The ORMS major is impacted. To be considered for admission, students should have a minimum of a 3.2 overall grade point average (GPA) in the prerequisite courses. Applications must be submitted by invitation only. To be considered for invitation, request to be added to the waiting list by contacting Anayancy Paz, 4145 Etcheverry Hall, <a href="mailto:anayancy@berkeley.edu">anayancy@berkeley.edu</a>. The program plan cannot be approved if students will have completed more than 80 semester units prior to their last intended semester (AP units do not count towards this 80-unit ceiling).</p>
<p>All four prerequisite classes (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MATH%2053" title="MATH 53" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 53');">MATH 53</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MATH%2054" title="MATH 54" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 54');">MATH 54</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ECON%201" title="ECON 1" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ECON 1');">ECON 1</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ECON%202" title="ECON 2" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ECON 2');">ECON 2</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ECON%20C3" title="ECON C3" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ECON C3');">ECON C3</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=UGBA%2010" title="UGBA 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'UGBA 10');">UGBA 10</a></span>) must be completed prior to acceptance to the major and all must be taken for a letter grade. Transfer students should apply at the end of their first semester at Berkeley. Admissions decisions will not be made until any prerequisite courses in progress are finished, and grades are available.</p>

<p>Many factors are considered in determining admission. The main criterion is academic performance as measured by the Berkeley GPA in the prerequisite courses. </p>
<p><span>Since this major is capped, it is a good idea to have a backup plan. There is an Operations Research concentration in the Math Department that might be a good choice if students are not admitted to the ORMS major.</span></p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with a grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.5 overall and 3.7 in the major should consider participating in the ORMS honors program. To graduate with honors, a student must find a faculty sponsor appropriate for an original research project that he or she wishes to do and enroll in two semesters (6 units) of the honors thesis course.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a student may take two approved graduate courses in Operations Research or a related field, and achieve at least an A- in each course. Courses used for the honors program cannot be used to fulfill the requirements for IEOR graduate programs. The student must also maintain a minimum 3.5 overall GPA and 3.7 in the major.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Operations Research and Management Science.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://ieor.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Operations Research and Management Science (ORMS) major is designed for students in the College of Letters &amp; Science. It provides a solid foundation in the quantitative, model building, and problem-solving skills of operations research and management science. It also gives students the flexibility to learn more about a particular field of interest to them in which they can apply these skills.</p>
<p>The major is very math intensive and is appropriate for students who enjoy and are good at mathematics, computers, and solving practical, multidisciplinary problems. </p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students can declare a major after they have completed at least one semester at UC Berkeley. The ORMS major is impacted. To be considered for admission, students should have a minimum of a 3.2 overall grade point average (GPA) in the prerequisite courses. Applications must be submitted by invitation only. To be considered for invitation, request to be added to the waiting list by contacting Anayancy Paz, 4145 Etcheverry Hall, <a href="mailto:anayancy@berkeley.edu">anayancy@berkeley.edu</a>. The program plan cannot be approved if students will have completed more than 80 semester units prior to their last intended semester (AP units do not count towards this 80-unit ceiling).</p>
<p>All four prerequisite classes (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MATH%2053" title="MATH 53" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 53');">MATH 53</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MATH%2054" title="MATH 54" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 54');">MATH 54</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ECON%201" title="ECON 1" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ECON 1');">ECON 1</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ECON%202" title="ECON 2" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ECON 2');">ECON 2</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ECON%20C3" title="ECON C3" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ECON C3');">ECON C3</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=UGBA%2010" title="UGBA 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'UGBA 10');">UGBA 10</a></span>) must be completed prior to acceptance to the major and all must be taken for a letter grade. Transfer students should apply at the end of their first semester at Berkeley. Admissions decisions will not be made until any prerequisite courses in progress are finished, and grades are available.</p>

<p>Many factors are considered in determining admission. The main criterion is academic performance as measured by the Berkeley GPA in the prerequisite courses. </p>
<p><span>Since this major is capped, it is a good idea to have a backup plan. There is an Operations Research concentration in the Math Department that might be a good choice if students are not admitted to the ORMS major.</span></p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with a grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.5 overall and 3.7 in the major should consider participating in the ORMS honors program. To graduate with honors, a student must find a faculty sponsor appropriate for an original research project that he or she wishes to do and enroll in two semesters (6 units) of the honors thesis course.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a student may take two approved graduate courses in Operations Research or a related field, and achieve at least an A- in each course. Courses used for the honors program cannot be used to fulfill the requirements for IEOR graduate programs. The student must also maintain a minimum 3.5 overall GPA and 3.7 in the major.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Operations Research and Management Science.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://ieor.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a <em>Pass/No Pass </em>basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs, with the exception of minors offered outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Operations Research and Management Science (ORMS) major is designed for students in the College of Letters &amp; Science. It provides a solid foundation in the quantitative, model building, and problem-solving skills of operations research and management science. It also gives students the flexibility to learn more about a particular field of interest to them in which they can apply these skills.</p>
<p>The major is very math intensive and is appropriate for students who enjoy and are good at mathematics, computers, and solving practical, multidisciplinary problems. </p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students can declare a major after they have completed at least one semester at UC Berkeley. The ORMS major is impacted. To be considered for admission, students should have a minimum of a 3.2 overall grade point average (GPA) in the prerequisite courses. Applications must be submitted by invitation only. To be considered for invitation, request to be added to the waiting list by contacting Anayancy Paz, 4145 Etcheverry Hall, <a href="mailto:anayancy@berkeley.edu">anayancy@berkeley.edu</a>. The program plan cannot be approved if students will have completed more than 80 semester units prior to their last intended semester (AP units do not count towards this 80-unit ceiling).</p>
<p>All four prerequisite classes (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MATH%2053" title="MATH 53" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 53');">MATH 53</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MATH%2054" title="MATH 54" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MATH 54');">MATH 54</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ECON%201" title="ECON 1" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ECON 1');">ECON 1</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ECON%202" title="ECON 2" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ECON 2');">ECON 2</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ECON%20C3" title="ECON C3" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ECON C3');">ECON C3</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=UGBA%2010" title="UGBA 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'UGBA 10');">UGBA 10</a></span>) must be completed prior to acceptance to the major and all must be taken for a letter grade. Transfer students should apply at the end of their first semester at Berkeley. Admissions decisions will not be made until any prerequisite courses in progress are finished, and grades are available.</p>

<p>Many factors are considered in determining admission. The main criterion is academic performance as measured by the Berkeley GPA in the prerequisite courses. </p>
<p><span>Since this major is capped, it is a good idea to have a backup plan. There is an Operations Research concentration in the Math Department that might be a good choice if students are not admitted to the ORMS major.</span></p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with a grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.5 overall and 3.7 in the major should consider participating in the ORMS honors program. To graduate with honors, a student must find a faculty sponsor appropriate for an original research project that he or she wishes to do and enroll in two semesters (6 units) of the honors thesis course.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a student may take two approved graduate courses in Operations Research or a related field, and achieve at least an A- in each course. Courses used for the honors program cannot be used to fulfill the requirements for IEOR graduate programs. The student must also maintain a minimum 3.5 overall GPA and 3.7 in the major.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Operations Research and Management Science.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://ieor.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

			<div id="majorrequirementstextcontainer" class="tab_content" role="tabpanel">
				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a <em>Pass/No Pass </em>basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs, with the exception of minors offered outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding residence requirements and unit requirements, please see the College Requirements tab.</p>

This is an introductory course in stochastic models. It builds upon a basic course in probability theory and extends the concept of a single random variable into collections of random variables known as stochastic processes. The course focuses on discrete-time Markov chains, Poisson process, continuous-time Markov chains, and renewal theory. It also discusses applications to queueing</span><span class="deschide"> theory, risk analysis and reliability theory. Along with the theory, the course covers stochastic simulation techniques that will allow students to go beyond the models and applications discussed in the course.</span><br/>
