				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Political Science major is concerned with exploring the exercise of power in its myriad forms and consequences. Students in the major are encouraged to explore central issues, such as the ethical problems attendant to the exercise of power; the history of important political ideas, such as liberty, justice, community, and morality; the impact of historical, economic, and social forces on the operation of politics; the functioning and distinctive features of the US political system; the diversity of political systems and the significance of these differences; and the interactions among international actors and the causes of war and peace. Undergraduate courses in political science vary from large lectures of 325 students to small seminars of 18 students. The courses are challenging, often emphasizing critical reading and analytical writing.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>To declare the major, students must have completed the minimum eligibility and must attend a declaration-orientation session. For information regarding minimum eligibility, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page. Transfer students may go to <a href="http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html">assist.org</a> for a list of California community college courses that satisfy University and major requirements. Upper division courses in the major are restricted to declared Political Science majors in Phase 1 of registration and usually fill before Phase 1 ends, so students should declare, if eligible, before the start of Phase 1 of registration.</p>
<p>Students must attend a Major Declaration Session to declare the major:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Pick a date from the calendar on the website linked below. Students will be eligible to attend a Major Declaration Session after they have completed the final for their second introductory Political Science course.</li>
	<li>Gather transcript(s) and make copies of them to submit. See more on transcripts below.</li>
	<li>Come early to secure a spot! The first 25 students who arrive at each session will be accepted to attend the session (unless indicated otherwise). Sessions held early and late in the semester as well as during the registration period are usually full. A sign-up sheet is available an hour before the session; there is no need to arrive earlier than an hour before the posted time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not come to a declaration session without all needed transcripts. This includes transcripts (unofficial transcripts are okay) for courses taken at community colleges, other universities, and UC Berkeley. For UC Berkeley courses, students can print out their Academic Summary on Cal Central. One copy of each transcript is all that is required. Academic Progress Reports and Transfer Credit Reports from CalCentral are not acceptable. The department keeps the transcript, so students should bring a copy they can spare. (Transcripts for courses that do not count for the major are not needed.)</p>
<p>A declaration session takes about an hour and includes a brief orientation to the major and Q&amp;A after which declaration forms are completed (forms are supplied — students supply the transcripts).</p>
<p>For a schedule of Major Declaration Sessions, please see the <a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-program/declaring-major">department website</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Declared Political Science majors with a 3.5 grade-point average (GPA) in the major and a 3.3 overall GPA who have senior standing and have completed at least two letter-graded upper division political science courses at Berkeley are eligible to apply for the honors program. The honors program consists of a two-semester seminar, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL%20SCI%20H190A" title="POL SCI H190A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI H190A');">POL SCI H190A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL%20SCI%20H190B" title="POL SCI H190B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI H190B');">POL SCI H190B</a></span> (offered in fall/spring only), and culminates in the writing of an honors thesis. Students must also obtain the sponsorship of a member of the faculty who will guide the research. Applications can only be made <a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/undergrad/opportunities/honors">online</a>; please refer to the undergraduate program section of the website. Departmental honors are awarded upon completion of the honors seminar with a grade of B+ or better, a minimum GPA of 3.5 in the major, and a 3.3 in overall work at Berkeley.</p>

<p class="p1"><span id="docs-internal-guid-921eb48b-588b-3bf1-d21b-8ece91e84adf">For students considering graduating in less than four years, it's important to acknowledge the reasons to undertake such a plan of study. While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation.

This course provides an overview of some of the methods employed in political science research. Its purpose is to familiarize you with the scientific study of politics, and to teach you how to pose and answer<br/>
empirical research questions using appropriate evidence and arguments. Along the way we will learn about how to formulate and evaluate theories, how to design research to discover whether a<br/>
particular</span><span class="deschide"> theory holds up empirically, and some basic research strategies. By the end of the course you should have the tools to critically evaluate the kinds of social science arguments found in everyday life and be able to conduct your own independent research.</span><br/>

In this class, the revolution against traditional political authority embodied in Jefferson's and Thomas Paine's attack on the British crown, the rise of slavery, and the conflict with Native America are seen as coherent parts of a cultural and social development that emerges in 18th- and 19th-century America. Using both original antebellum materials, including biographies, history, and literature, and contemporary images from American popular</span><span class="deschide"> culture such as film, news and magazine articles, and music, we will compare and contrast the experiences of antebellum Native Americans, Euopean immigrants, and African slaves as a connection between the past and the present emerges.</span><br/>

What is governance? How should we explain its emergence? What are its implications for public policy and democracy? This course uses debates about contemporary governance to examine four approaches to political science and political theory. The approaches are rational choice theory, institutionalism, Marxism, and poststructuralism. The course looks at the narrative that each approach provides of the origins and workings of governance since 1979</span><span class="deschide">, and at the way these narratives embody theoretical commitments about rationality and power, structure and agency, and democracy. It thus promotes an awareness of the way questions about contemporary governance are inextricably linked to philosophical and normative commitments.</span><br/>

The goal of this class is to familiarize students with the various ways in which actors can manage and resolve their conflicts. Conflict management in both international and civil conflicts will be discussed. Students will learn about negotiation, mediation, arbitration and adjudication, sanctions, military intervention, peacekeeping, nation-building, and the design of peace agreements. We will also talk about the role of the United Nations</span><span class="deschide">, regional organizations, and major powers like the U.S. in conflict management.

This course provides an introduction to game theory and its application in social science, especially political science and economics. The purposes of the course are to give students a sense of the field of game theory and how political scientists use it in making arguments about how government and politics work, to develop students' intuition about strategic situations in everyday life, and to</span><span class="deschide"> develop students' analytical capabilities generally. Upon completion of the course, students will be able to depict social situations as simple game theoretic models, analyze those models to understand how the behaviors of the individuals involved are mutually reinforcing, and apply computer-based tools to evaluate under conditions of uncertainty.</span><br/>

This course examines the interaction between politics and markets, both in theory and in practice, explicitly linking classic works on political economy with current policy debates. We study how political systems and markets are organized in a wide range of different national settings, looking at both history and contemporary issues. Topics include: 1) early industrialization in Britain and the United States, 2) late industrialization in continental</span><span class="deschide"> Europe and Japan, 3) the varieties of capitalism in contemporary industrialized countries, 4) the newly industrializing economics of Latin America and East Asia, 5) the problems of development, and 6) the transition from communism to a market economy in Eastern Europe and China.</span><br/>

This course will examine international migration from a historical and comparative perspective, looking at why people migrate, how citizens respond to the migration, and how states respond to migration. The first part of the course looks at the changing relationship between the state, immigrants, and citizenship. Turning to case studies, we will examine five different types of receiving states, each confronted</span><span class="deschide"> with a different form of migration: a traditional immigrant state, a post-colonial state, a non-traditional immigrant state that imports migrant workers, a highly industrialized latecomer state, and a newly industrialized state.</span><br/>

In the present era political, economic, and social organization powerfully influence national capacity to assure economic success, real and rising incomes for the population, and political success, basic survival, and the projection of its purposes and values. This course looks at the continual process of international competition and transformation, and examines which factors separate the winners from the losers. We will gain leverage into</span><span class="deschide"> these questions by examining critical moments in the 20th and 21st centuries and analyze according to national responses. What choices signal success? Can the failures be avoided? The course will discuss whether globalization is shunting aside national political choice, or whether globalization is in fact a sequence of national and regional stories played out on a larger stage. We will consider how economic constraint structures political choice and national response to the global economy. But we will also examine how political developments shape market dynamics and national innovations. We will learn about all sorts of things from the politics of French fashion to why Japanese make good cars.</span><br/>

This course explores the sources of political beliefs and actions through the application of psychological theories about personality, learning, cognition, and group dynamics. The course begins by briefly considering a number of alternative analytic approaches to linking human nature and politics and then considers such problems as political ideology, persuasion, compliance, protest</span><span class="deschide">, violence, and leadership in terms of these approaches. The course considers both mass and elite political behavior. The readings include both quantitative materials drawn from survey research and experiments and more impressionistic and clinical studies.</span><br/>

Students will explore, discuss, and understand the relationship between racial/ethnic group formation, group-based beliefs and behavior, and politics. Our focus is on the US today, but with an appreciation of how the racial politics of the here and now is rooted in history and human psychology. We cover Black Politics, Latinx Politics, Asian American Politics, Native American Politics and White Politics, general concepts of identity, immigration, citizenship, class</span><span class="deschide">, and intersectionality. We examine both how race and ethnicity affect politics, as well as how politics can shape the boundaries, definitions and behaviors of groups. These behaviors include voting, elite decisions, civic engagement, protests, and media content and usage.</span><br/>

Some of the most enduring and violent conflicts in America center on race. The goal of this course is to explore, discuss, and better understand the relationship between perceptions of racial identity, attributions of racial difference, and politics, broadly defined. We focus on the recent and persistent debates about racism, identity, rights, representation, citizenship, conflict, and coalitions. A repeated theme of this course is the question</span><span class="deschide"> whether racial order and inequality are essential to, or an exception from, the liberal democracy in the U.S. This is a lecture course with intensive readings, written assignments, and in-class discussion.</span><br/>

This course explores the way societies try to address and solve difficult and seemingly intractable public problems. Can we attribute success or failure to institutions and their capacity to solve problems? Are problems difficult to solve because they are complex or because of a failure of political will? What are the characteristics of organizations or communities that are able to solve problems? How are public problems framed and how are</span><span class="deschide"> they used to mobilize constituencies? The course draws on literature in public administration, public policy studies, and democratic theory to try to better understand some of the major social, political, environmental, and economic problems of our contemporary world.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Political Science major is concerned with exploring the exercise of power in its myriad forms and consequences. Students in the major are encouraged to explore central issues, such as the ethical problems attendant to the exercise of power; the history of important political ideas, such as liberty, justice, community, and morality; the impact of historical, economic, and social forces on the operation of politics; the functioning and distinctive features of the US political system; the diversity of political systems and the significance of these differences; and the interactions among international actors and the causes of war and peace. Undergraduate courses in political science vary from large lectures of 325 students to small seminars of 18 students. The courses are challenging, often emphasizing critical reading and analytical writing.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>To declare the major, students must have completed the minimum eligibility and must attend a declaration-orientation session. For information regarding minimum eligibility, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page. Transfer students may go to <a href="http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html">assist.org</a> for a list of California community college courses that satisfy University and major requirements. Upper division courses in the major are restricted to declared Political Science majors in Phase 1 of registration and usually fill before Phase 1 ends, so students should declare, if eligible, before the start of Phase 1 of registration.</p>
<p>Students must attend a Major Declaration Session to declare the major:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Pick a date from the calendar on the website linked below. Students will be eligible to attend a Major Declaration Session after they have completed the final for their second introductory Political Science course.</li>
	<li>Gather transcript(s) and make copies of them to submit. See more on transcripts below.</li>
	<li>Come early to secure a spot! The first 25 students who arrive at each session will be accepted to attend the session (unless indicated otherwise). Sessions held early and late in the semester as well as during the registration period are usually full. A sign-up sheet is available an hour before the session; there is no need to arrive earlier than an hour before the posted time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not come to a declaration session without all needed transcripts. This includes transcripts (unofficial transcripts are okay) for courses taken at community colleges, other universities, and UC Berkeley. For UC Berkeley courses, students can print out their Academic Summary on Cal Central. One copy of each transcript is all that is required. Academic Progress Reports and Transfer Credit Reports from CalCentral are not acceptable. The department keeps the transcript, so students should bring a copy they can spare. (Transcripts for courses that do not count for the major are not needed.)</p>
<p>A declaration session takes about an hour and includes a brief orientation to the major and Q&amp;A after which declaration forms are completed (forms are supplied — students supply the transcripts).</p>
<p>For a schedule of Major Declaration Sessions, please see the <a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-program/declaring-major">department website</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Declared Political Science majors with a 3.5 grade-point average (GPA) in the major and a 3.3 overall GPA who have senior standing and have completed at least two letter-graded upper division political science courses at Berkeley are eligible to apply for the honors program. The honors program consists of a two-semester seminar, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL%20SCI%20H190A" title="POL SCI H190A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI H190A');">POL SCI H190A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL%20SCI%20H190B" title="POL SCI H190B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI H190B');">POL SCI H190B</a></span> (offered in fall/spring only), and culminates in the writing of an honors thesis. Students must also obtain the sponsorship of a member of the faculty who will guide the research. Applications can only be made <a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/undergrad/opportunities/honors">online</a>; please refer to the undergraduate program section of the website. Departmental honors are awarded upon completion of the honors seminar with a grade of B+ or better, a minimum GPA of 3.5 in the major, and a 3.3 in overall work at Berkeley.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Political Science.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

In 1AC, we learn about the institutions, ideologies, and processes that constitute politics in the U.S. In fulfilling the AC requirement, we further examine how power, equality, and diversity are configured and contested in our politics. The</span><span class="deschide"> course emphasizes active research- and group-based learning.</span><br/>

This course aims to furnish students with the tools necessary to study political processes and outcomes in comparative perspective. It is divided into three parts. The first introduces the basic concepts and methods of comparative analysis and examines our principal unit of analysis: the state. The second surveys the range of political regimes under which people live around the world. The third examines three</span><span class="deschide"> key variables that both influence political outcomes and are influenced by political processes: institutions, identity, and agency.

This course provides an overview of some of the methods employed in political science research. Its purpose is to familiarize you with the scientific study of politics, and to teach you how to pose and answer<br/>
empirical research questions using appropriate evidence and arguments. Along the way we will learn about how to formulate and evaluate theories, how to design research to discover whether a<br/>
particular</span><span class="deschide"> theory holds up empirically, and some basic research strategies. By the end of the course you should have the tools to critically evaluate the kinds of social science arguments found in everyday life and be able to conduct your own independent research.</span><br/>

In this class, the revolution against traditional political authority embodied in Jefferson's and Thomas Paine's attack on the British crown, the rise of slavery, and the conflict with Native America are seen as coherent parts of a cultural and social development that emerges in 18th- and 19th-century America. Using both original antebellum materials, including biographies, history, and literature, and contemporary images from American popular</span><span class="deschide"> culture such as film, news and magazine articles, and music, we will compare and contrast the experiences of antebellum Native Americans, Euopean immigrants, and African slaves as a connection between the past and the present emerges.</span><br/>

What is governance? How should we explain its emergence? What are its implications for public policy and democracy? This course uses debates about contemporary governance to examine four approaches to political science and political theory. The approaches are rational choice theory, institutionalism, Marxism, and poststructuralism. The course looks at the narrative that each approach provides of the origins and workings of governance since 1979</span><span class="deschide">, and at the way these narratives embody theoretical commitments about rationality and power, structure and agency, and democracy. It thus promotes an awareness of the way questions about contemporary governance are inextricably linked to philosophical and normative commitments.</span><br/>

The goal of this class is to familiarize students with the various ways in which actors can manage and resolve their conflicts. Conflict management in both international and civil conflicts will be discussed. Students will learn about negotiation, mediation, arbitration and adjudication, sanctions, military intervention, peacekeeping, nation-building, and the design of peace agreements. We will also talk about the role of the United Nations</span><span class="deschide">, regional organizations, and major powers like the U.S. in conflict management. While the main goal of the class is to familiarize students with central concepts and theories of conflict management, we will also take a look at cases that illustrate when, how and why different strategies work.</span><br/>

Upon completion of the course, students will be able to depict social situations as simple game theoretic models, analyze those models to understand how the behaviors of the individuals involved are mutually reinforcing, and apply computer-based tools to evaluate under conditions of uncertainty.</span><br/>

In the present era political, economic, and social organization powerfully influence national capacity to assure economic success, real and rising incomes for the population, and political success, basic survival, and the projection of its purposes and values. This course looks at the continual process of international competition and transformation, and examines which factors separate the winners from the losers. We will gain leverage into</span><span class="deschide"> these questions by examining critical moments in the 20th and 21st centuries and analyze according to national responses. What choices signal success? Can the failures be avoided? The course will discuss whether globalization is shunting aside national political choice, or whether globalization is in fact a sequence of national and regional stories played out on a larger stage. We will consider how economic constraint structures political choice and national response to the global economy. But we will also examine how political developments shape market dynamics and national innovations. We will learn about all sorts of things from the politics of French fashion to why Japanese make good cars.</span><br/>

Over half of the world's population is now urban. As urban populations swell, metropolitan areas in both the developed and the developing world struggle to provide basic services and address the negative externalities associated with rapid growth. Sanitation, transportation, pollution, energy services, and public safety typically fall to sub-national governments. Yet local sub-national institutions face difficulties as they tackle these challenges</span><span class="deschide"> because development tends to spill over political boundaries and resources are limited.

This course explores the sources of political beliefs and actions through the application of psychological theories about personality, learning, cognition, and group dynamics. The course begins by briefly considering a number of alternative analytic approaches to linking human nature and politics and then considers such problems as political ideology, persuasion, compliance, protest</span><span class="deschide">, violence, and leadership in terms of these approaches. The course considers both mass and elite political behavior. The readings include both quantitative materials drawn from survey research and experiments and more impressionistic and clinical studies.</span><br/>

Students will explore, discuss, and understand the relationship between racial/ethnic group formation, group-based beliefs and behavior, and politics. Our focus is on the US today, but with an appreciation of how the racial politics of the here and now is rooted in history and human psychology. We cover Black Politics, Latinx Politics, Asian American Politics, Native American Politics and White Politics, general concepts of identity, immigration, citizenship, class</span><span class="deschide">, and intersectionality. We examine both how race and ethnicity affect politics, as well as how politics can shape the boundaries, definitions and behaviors of groups. These behaviors include voting, elite decisions, civic engagement, protests, and media content and usage.</span><br/>

Some of the most enduring and violent conflicts in America center on race. The goal of this course is to explore, discuss, and better understand the relationship between perceptions of racial identity, attributions of racial difference, and politics, broadly defined. We focus on the recent and persistent debates about racism, identity, rights, representation, citizenship, conflict, and coalitions. A repeated theme of this course is the question</span><span class="deschide"> whether racial order and inequality are essential to, or an exception from, the liberal democracy in the U.S. This is a lecture course with intensive readings, written assignments, and in-class discussion.</span><br/>

This course explores the way societies try to address and solve difficult and seemingly intractable public problems. Can we attribute success or failure to institutions and their capacity to solve problems? Are problems difficult to solve because they are complex or because of a failure of political will? What are the characteristics of organizations or communities that are able to solve problems? How are public problems framed and how are</span><span class="deschide"> they used to mobilize constituencies? The course draws on literature in public administration, public policy studies, and democratic theory to try to better understand some of the major social, political, environmental, and economic problems of our contemporary world.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Political Science major is concerned with exploring the exercise of power in its myriad forms and consequences. Students in the major are encouraged to explore central issues, such as the ethical problems attendant to the exercise of power; the history of important political ideas, such as liberty, justice, community, and morality; the impact of historical, economic, and social forces on the operation of politics; the functioning and distinctive features of the US political system; the diversity of political systems and the significance of these differences; and the interactions among international actors and the causes of war and peace. Undergraduate courses in political science vary from large lectures of 325 students to small seminars of 18 students. The courses are challenging, often emphasizing critical reading and analytical writing.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>To declare the major, students must have completed the minimum eligibility and must attend a declaration-orientation session. For information regarding minimum eligibility, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page. Transfer students may go to <a href="http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html">assist.org</a> for a list of California community college courses that satisfy University and major requirements. Upper division courses in the major are restricted to declared Political Science majors in Phase 1 of registration and usually fill before Phase 1 ends, so students should declare, if eligible, before the start of Phase 1 of registration.</p>
<p>Students must attend a Major Declaration Session to declare the major:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Pick a date from the calendar on the website linked below. Students will be eligible to attend a Major Declaration Session after they have completed the final for their second introductory Political Science course.</li>
	<li>Gather transcript(s) and make copies of them to submit. See more on transcripts below.</li>
	<li>Come early to secure a spot! The first 25 students who arrive at each session will be accepted to attend the session (unless indicated otherwise). Sessions held early and late in the semester as well as during the registration period are usually full. A sign-up sheet is available an hour before the session; there is no need to arrive earlier than an hour before the posted time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not come to a declaration session without all needed transcripts. This includes transcripts (unofficial transcripts are okay) for courses taken at community colleges, other universities, and UC Berkeley. For UC Berkeley courses, students can print out their Academic Summary on Cal Central. One copy of each transcript is all that is required. Academic Progress Reports and Transfer Credit Reports from CalCentral are not acceptable. The department keeps the transcript, so students should bring a copy they can spare. (Transcripts for courses that do not count for the major are not needed.)</p>
<p>A declaration session takes about an hour and includes a brief orientation to the major and Q&amp;A after which declaration forms are completed (forms are supplied — students supply the transcripts).</p>
<p>For a schedule of Major Declaration Sessions, please see the <a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-program/declaring-major">department website</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Declared Political Science majors with a 3.5 grade-point average (GPA) in the major and a 3.3 overall GPA who have senior standing and have completed at least two letter-graded upper division political science courses at Berkeley are eligible to apply for the honors program. The honors program consists of a two-semester seminar, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL%20SCI%20H190A" title="POL SCI H190A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI H190A');">POL SCI H190A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL%20SCI%20H190B" title="POL SCI H190B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI H190B');">POL SCI H190B</a></span> (offered in fall/spring only), and culminates in the writing of an honors thesis. Students must also obtain the sponsorship of a member of the faculty who will guide the research. Applications can only be made <a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/undergrad/opportunities/honors">online</a>; please refer to the undergraduate program section of the website. Departmental honors are awarded upon completion of the honors seminar with a grade of B+ or better, a minimum GPA of 3.5 in the major, and a 3.3 in overall work at Berkeley.</p>

<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Political Science.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

This course aims to furnish students with the tools necessary to study political processes and outcomes in comparative perspective. It is divided into three parts. The first introduces the basic concepts and methods of comparative analysis and examines our principal unit of analysis: the state. The second surveys the range of political regimes under which people live around the world. The third examines three</span><span class="deschide"> key variables that both influence political outcomes and are influenced by political processes: institutions, identity, and agency.

This course provides an overview of some of the methods employed in political science research. Its purpose is to familiarize you with the scientific study of politics, and to teach you how to pose and answer<br/>
empirical research questions using appropriate evidence and arguments. Along the way we will learn about how to formulate and evaluate theories, how to design research to discover whether a<br/>
particular</span><span class="deschide"> theory holds up empirically, and some basic research strategies. By the end of the course you should have the tools to critically evaluate the kinds of social science arguments found in everyday life and be able to conduct your own independent research.</span><br/>

In this class, the revolution against traditional political authority embodied in Jefferson's and Thomas Paine's attack on the British crown, the rise of slavery, and the conflict with Native America are seen as coherent parts of a cultural and social development that emerges in 18th- and 19th-century America. Using both original antebellum materials, including biographies, history, and literature, and contemporary images from American popular</span><span class="deschide"> culture such as film, news and magazine articles, and music, we will compare and contrast the experiences of antebellum Native Americans, Euopean immigrants, and African slaves as a connection between the past and the present emerges.</span><br/>

The approaches are rational choice theory, institutionalism, Marxism, and poststructuralism. The course looks at the narrative that each approach provides of the origins and workings of governance since 1979</span><span class="deschide">, and at the way these narratives embody theoretical commitments about rationality and power, structure and agency, and democracy. It thus promotes an awareness of the way questions about contemporary governance are inextricably linked to philosophical and normative commitments.</span><br/>

The goal of this class is to familiarize students with the various ways in which actors can manage and resolve their conflicts. Conflict management in both international and civil conflicts will be discussed. Students will learn about negotiation, mediation, arbitration and adjudication, sanctions, military intervention, peacekeeping, nation-building, and the design of peace agreements. We will also talk about the role of the United Nations</span><span class="deschide">, regional organizations, and major powers like the U.S. in conflict management. While the main goal of the class is to familiarize students with central concepts and theories of conflict management, we will also take a look at cases that illustrate when, how and why different strategies work.</span><br/>

Should nations intervene in other countries to prevent human rights abuses or famine? On what principles should immigration be based? Should wealthy states aid poorer states, and if so, how much?

In the present era political, economic, and social organization powerfully influence national capacity to assure economic success, real and rising incomes for the population, and political success, basic survival, and the projection of its purposes and values. This course looks at the continual process of international competition and transformation, and examines which factors separate the winners from the losers. We will gain leverage into</span><span class="deschide"> these questions by examining critical moments in the 20th and 21st centuries and analyze according to national responses. What choices signal success? Can the failures be avoided? The course will discuss whether globalization is shunting aside national political choice, or whether globalization is in fact a sequence of national and regional stories played out on a larger stage. We will consider how economic constraint structures political choice and national response to the global economy. But we will also examine how political developments shape market dynamics and national innovations. We will learn about all sorts of things from the politics of French fashion to why Japanese make good cars.</span><br/>

This course explores the sources of political beliefs and actions through the application of psychological theories about personality, learning, cognition, and group dynamics. The course begins by briefly considering a number of alternative analytic approaches to linking human nature and politics and then considers such problems as political ideology, persuasion, compliance, protest</span><span class="deschide">, violence, and leadership in terms of these approaches. The course considers both mass and elite political behavior. The readings include both quantitative materials drawn from survey research and experiments and more impressionistic and clinical studies.</span><br/>

Students will explore, discuss, and understand the relationship between racial/ethnic group formation, group-based beliefs and behavior, and politics. Our focus is on the US today, but with an appreciation of how the racial politics of the here and now is rooted in history and human psychology. We cover Black Politics, Latinx Politics, Asian American Politics, Native American Politics and White Politics, general concepts of identity, immigration, citizenship, class</span><span class="deschide">, and intersectionality. We examine both how race and ethnicity affect politics, as well as how politics can shape the boundaries, definitions and behaviors of groups. These behaviors include voting, elite decisions, civic engagement, protests, and media content and usage.</span><br/>

Some of the most enduring and violent conflicts in America center on race. The goal of this course is to explore, discuss, and better understand the relationship between perceptions of racial identity, attributions of racial difference, and politics, broadly defined. We focus on the recent and persistent debates about racism, identity, rights, representation, citizenship, conflict, and coalitions. A repeated theme of this course is the question</span><span class="deschide"> whether racial order and inequality are essential to, or an exception from, the liberal democracy in the U.S. This is a lecture course with intensive readings, written assignments, and in-class discussion.</span><br/>

This course explores the way societies try to address and solve difficult and seemingly intractable public problems. Can we attribute success or failure to institutions and their capacity to solve problems? Are problems difficult to solve because they are complex or because of a failure of political will? What are the characteristics of organizations or communities that are able to solve problems? How are public problems framed and how are</span><span class="deschide"> they used to mobilize constituencies? The course draws on literature in public administration, public policy studies, and democratic theory to try to better understand some of the major social, political, environmental, and economic problems of our contemporary world.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Political Science major is concerned with exploring the exercise of power in its myriad forms and consequences. Students in the major are encouraged to explore central issues, such as the ethical problems attendant to the exercise of power; the history of important political ideas, such as liberty, justice, community, and morality; the impact of historical, economic, and social forces on the operation of politics; the functioning and distinctive features of the US political system; the diversity of political systems and the significance of these differences; and the interactions among international actors and the causes of war and peace. Undergraduate courses in political science vary from large lectures of 325 students to small seminars of 18 students. The courses are challenging, often emphasizing critical reading and analytical writing.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>To declare the major, students must have completed the minimum eligibility and must attend a declaration-orientation session. For information regarding minimum eligibility, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page. Transfer students may go to <a href="http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html">assist.org</a> for a list of California community college courses that satisfy University and major requirements. Upper division courses in the major are restricted to declared Political Science majors in Phase 1 of registration and usually fill before Phase 1 ends, so students should declare, if eligible, before the start of Phase 1 of registration.</p>
<p>Students must attend a Major Declaration Session to declare the major:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Pick a date from the calendar on the website linked below. Students will be eligible to attend a Major Declaration Session after they have completed the final for their second introductory Political Science course.</li>
	<li>Gather transcript(s) and make copies of them to submit. See more on transcripts below.</li>
	<li>Come early to secure a spot! The first 25 students who arrive at each session will be accepted to attend the session (unless indicated otherwise). Sessions held early and late in the semester as well as during the registration period are usually full. A sign-up sheet is available an hour before the session; there is no need to arrive earlier than an hour before the posted time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not come to a declaration session without all needed transcripts. This includes transcripts (unofficial transcripts are okay) for courses taken at community colleges, other universities, and UC Berkeley. For UC Berkeley courses, students can print out their Academic Summary on Cal Central. One copy of each transcript is all that is required. Academic Progress Reports and Transfer Credit Reports from CalCentral are not acceptable. The department keeps the transcript, so students should bring a copy they can spare. (Transcripts for courses that do not count for the major are not needed.)</p>
<p>A declaration session takes about an hour and includes a brief orientation to the major and Q&amp;A after which declaration forms are completed (forms are supplied — students supply the transcripts).</p>
<p>For a schedule of Major Declaration Sessions, please see the <a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-program/declaring-major">department website</a>.</p>

<p class="p1"><span id="docs-internal-guid-921eb48b-588b-3bf1-d21b-8ece91e84adf">For students considering graduating in less than four years, it's important to acknowledge the reasons to undertake such a plan of study. While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation.

This course aims to furnish students with the tools necessary to study political processes and outcomes in comparative perspective. It is divided into three parts. The first introduces the basic concepts and methods of comparative analysis and examines our principal unit of analysis: the state. The second surveys the range of political regimes under which people live around the world. The third examines three</span><span class="deschide"> key variables that both influence political outcomes and are influenced by political processes: institutions, identity, and agency.

This course provides an overview of some of the methods employed in political science research. Its purpose is to familiarize you with the scientific study of politics, and to teach you how to pose and answer<br/>
empirical research questions using appropriate evidence and arguments. Along the way we will learn about how to formulate and evaluate theories, how to design research to discover whether a<br/>
particular</span><span class="deschide"> theory holds up empirically, and some basic research strategies. By the end of the course you should have the tools to critically evaluate the kinds of social science arguments found in everyday life and be able to conduct your own independent research.</span><br/>

In this class, the revolution against traditional political authority embodied in Jefferson's and Thomas Paine's attack on the British crown, the rise of slavery, and the conflict with Native America are seen as coherent parts of a cultural and social development that emerges in 18th- and 19th-century America. Using both original antebellum materials, including biographies, history, and literature, and contemporary images from American popular</span><span class="deschide"> culture such as film, news and magazine articles, and music, we will compare and contrast the experiences of antebellum Native Americans, Euopean immigrants, and African slaves as a connection between the past and the present emerges.</span><br/>

What is governance? How should we explain its emergence? What are its implications for public policy and democracy? This course uses debates about contemporary governance to examine four approaches to political science and political theory. The approaches are rational choice theory, institutionalism, Marxism, and poststructuralism. The course looks at the narrative that each approach provides of the origins and workings of governance since 1979</span><span class="deschide">, and at the way these narratives embody theoretical commitments about rationality and power, structure and agency, and democracy. It thus promotes an awareness of the way questions about contemporary governance are inextricably linked to philosophical and normative commitments.</span><br/>

This class begins with a historical overview of war in the region. The second part of the class introduces theories that complement and elaborate on theories from PS124A: arguments about the relationship between war and resources,religion, authoritarianism, civil military relations, territorial disputes, sovereignty, and power. In the third part of the course, we will explore current policy concerns related to conflict in the region: Nuclear proliferation</span><span class="deschide">, terrorism, the civil war in Syria, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, drone warfare, and the U.S. role in the region.</span><br/>

This course examines the interaction between politics and markets, both in theory and in practice, explicitly linking classic works on political economy with current policy debates. We study how political systems and markets are organized in a wide range of different national settings, looking at both history and contemporary issues. Topics include: 1) early industrialization in Britain and the United States, 2) late industrialization in continental</span><span class="deschide"> Europe and Japan, 3) the varieties of capitalism in contemporary industrialized countries, 4) the newly industrializing economics of Latin America and East Asia, 5) the problems of development, and 6) the transition from communism to a market economy in Eastern Europe and China.</span><br/>

This course will examine international migration from a historical and comparative perspective, looking at why people migrate, how citizens respond to the migration, and how states respond to migration. The first part of the course looks at the changing relationship between the state, immigrants, and citizenship. Turning to case studies, we will examine five different types of receiving states, each confronted</span><span class="deschide"> with a different form of migration: a traditional immigrant state, a post-colonial state, a non-traditional immigrant state that imports migrant workers, a highly industrialized latecomer state, and a newly industrialized state.</span><br/>

In the present era political, economic, and social organization powerfully influence national capacity to assure economic success, real and rising incomes for the population, and political success, basic survival, and the projection of its purposes and values. This course looks at the continual process of international competition and transformation, and examines which factors separate the winners from the losers. We will gain leverage into</span><span class="deschide"> these questions by examining critical moments in the 20th and 21st centuries and analyze according to national responses. What choices signal success? Can the failures be avoided? The course will discuss whether globalization is shunting aside national political choice, or whether globalization is in fact a sequence of national and regional stories played out on a larger stage. We will consider how economic constraint structures political choice and national response to the global economy. But we will also examine how political developments shape market dynamics and national innovations. We will learn about all sorts of things from the politics of French fashion to why Japanese make good cars.</span><br/>

These conflicts can lead to violence and hardship. They can also result in creative adaptations and solutions based in political and administrative institutions and processes that build peace. The first three weeks of the course examine global trends and institutions; the last three weeks examine the</span><span class="deschide"> specific dynamics involving land and resource conflict in Kenya. Throughout the course, students will be introduced to social science and environmental science perspectives. Students will be exposed to the analytical tools of political economy, history, and political ecology. The class will consist of students from the University of California, Berkeley and Kenyatta University. It will be led by faculty from both institutions.</span><br/>

French political life has long gravitated around a &quot;Republican model&quot; marked by an unmediated relationship between the citizen and the state, socialization into French values through secular public education, a special vocation for France on the international stage, and an activist state. Recent developments have called the Republican model into question.

This course explores the sources of political beliefs and actions through the application of psychological theories about personality, learning, cognition, and group dynamics. The course begins by briefly considering a number of alternative analytic approaches to linking human nature and politics and then considers such problems as political ideology, persuasion, compliance, protest</span><span class="deschide">, violence, and leadership in terms of these approaches. The course considers both mass and elite political behavior. The readings include both quantitative materials drawn from survey research and experiments and more impressionistic and clinical studies.</span><br/>

Students will explore, discuss, and understand the relationship between racial/ethnic group formation, group-based beliefs and behavior, and politics. Our focus is on the US today, but with an appreciation of how the racial politics of the here and now is rooted in history and human psychology. We cover Black Politics, Latinx Politics, Asian American Politics, Native American Politics and White Politics, general concepts of identity, immigration, citizenship, class</span><span class="deschide">, and intersectionality. We examine both how race and ethnicity affect politics, as well as how politics can shape the boundaries, definitions and behaviors of groups. These behaviors include voting, elite decisions, civic engagement, protests, and media content and usage.</span><br/>

Some of the most enduring and violent conflicts in America center on race. The goal of this course is to explore, discuss, and better understand the relationship between perceptions of racial identity, attributions of racial difference, and politics, broadly defined. We focus on the recent and persistent debates about racism, identity, rights, representation, citizenship, conflict, and coalitions. A repeated theme of this course is the question</span><span class="deschide"> whether racial order and inequality are essential to, or an exception from, the liberal democracy in the U.S. This is a lecture course with intensive readings, written assignments, and in-class discussion.</span><br/>

This course explores the way societies try to address and solve difficult and seemingly intractable public problems. Can we attribute success or failure to institutions and their capacity to solve problems? Are problems difficult to solve because they are complex or because of a failure of political will? What are the characteristics of organizations or communities that are able to solve problems? How are public problems framed and how are</span><span class="deschide"> they used to mobilize constituencies? The course draws on literature in public administration, public policy studies, and democratic theory to try to better understand some of the major social, political, environmental, and economic problems of our contemporary world.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Political Science major is concerned with exploring the exercise of power in its myriad forms and consequences. Students in the major are encouraged to explore central issues, such as the ethical problems attendant to the exercise of power; the history of important political ideas, such as liberty, justice, community, and morality; the impact of historical, economic, and social forces on the operation of politics; the functioning and distinctive features of the US political system; the diversity of political systems and the significance of these differences; and the interactions among international actors and the causes of war and peace. Undergraduate courses in political science vary from large lectures of 325 students to small seminars of 18 students. The courses are challenging, often emphasizing critical reading and analytical writing.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>To declare the major, students must have completed the minimum eligibility and must attend a declaration-orientation session. For information regarding minimum eligibility, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page. Transfer students may go to <a href="http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html">assist.org</a> for a list of California community college courses that satisfy University and major requirements. Upper division courses in the major are restricted to declared Political Science majors in Phase 1 of registration and usually fill before Phase 1 ends, so students should declare, if eligible, before the start of Phase 1 of registration.</p>
<p>Students must attend a Major Declaration Session to declare the major:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Pick a date from the calendar on the website linked below. Students will be eligible to attend a Major Declaration Session after they have completed the final for their second introductory Political Science course.</li>
	<li>Gather transcript(s) and make copies of them to submit. See more on transcripts below.</li>
	<li>Come early to secure a spot! The first 25 students who arrive at each session will be accepted to attend the session (unless indicated otherwise). Sessions held early and late in the semester as well as during the registration period are usually full. A sign-up sheet is available an hour before the session; there is no need to arrive earlier than an hour before the posted time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not come to a declaration session without all needed transcripts. This includes transcripts (unofficial transcripts are okay) for courses taken at community colleges, other universities, and UC Berkeley. For UC Berkeley courses, students can print out their Academic Summary on Cal Central. One copy of each transcript is all that is required. Academic Progress Reports and Transfer Credit Reports from CalCentral are not acceptable. The department keeps the transcript, so students should bring a copy they can spare. (Transcripts for courses that do not count for the major are not needed.)</p>
<p>A declaration session takes about an hour and includes a brief orientation to the major and Q&amp;A after which declaration forms are completed (forms are supplied — students supply the transcripts).</p>
<p>For a schedule of Major Declaration Sessions, please see the <a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-program/declaring-major">department website</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Declared Political Science majors with a 3.5 grade-point average (GPA) in the major and a 3.3 overall GPA who have senior standing and have completed at least two letter-graded upper division political science courses at Berkeley are eligible to apply for the honors program. The honors program consists of a two-semester seminar, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL%20SCI%20H190A" title="POL SCI H190A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI H190A');">POL SCI H190A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=POL%20SCI%20H190B" title="POL SCI H190B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'POL SCI H190B');">POL SCI H190B</a></span> (offered in fall/spring only), and culminates in the writing of an honors thesis. Students must also obtain the sponsorship of a member of the faculty who will guide the research. Applications can only be made <a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/undergrad/opportunities/honors">online</a>; please refer to the undergraduate program section of the website. Departmental honors are awarded upon completion of the honors seminar with a grade of B+ or better, a minimum GPA of 3.5 in the major, and a 3.3 in overall work at Berkeley.</p>

<p class="p1"><span id="docs-internal-guid-921eb48b-588b-3bf1-d21b-8ece91e84adf">For students considering graduating in less than four years, it's important to acknowledge the reasons to undertake such a plan of study. While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation.

This course provides an overview of some of the methods employed in political science research. Its purpose is to familiarize you with the scientific study of politics, and to teach you how to pose and answer<br/>
empirical research questions using appropriate evidence and arguments. Along the way we will learn about how to formulate and evaluate theories, how to design research to discover whether a<br/>
particular</span><span class="deschide"> theory holds up empirically, and some basic research strategies. By the end of the course you should have the tools to critically evaluate the kinds of social science arguments found in everyday life and be able to conduct your own independent research.</span><br/>

In this class, the revolution against traditional political authority embodied in Jefferson's and Thomas Paine's attack on the British crown, the rise of slavery, and the conflict with Native America are seen as coherent parts of a cultural and social development that emerges in 18th- and 19th-century America. Using both original antebellum materials, including biographies, history, and literature, and contemporary images from American popular</span><span class="deschide"> culture such as film, news and magazine articles, and music, we will compare and contrast the experiences of antebellum Native Americans, Euopean immigrants, and African slaves as a connection between the past and the present emerges.</span><br/>

What is governance? How should we explain its emergence? What are its implications for public policy and democracy? This course uses debates about contemporary governance to examine four approaches to political science and political theory. The approaches are rational choice theory, institutionalism, Marxism, and poststructuralism. The course looks at the narrative that each approach provides of the origins and workings of governance since 1979</span><span class="deschide">, and at the way these narratives embody theoretical commitments about rationality and power, structure and agency, and democracy. It thus promotes an awareness of the way questions about contemporary governance are inextricably linked to philosophical and normative commitments.</span><br/>

The goal of this class is to familiarize students with the various ways in which actors can manage and resolve their conflicts. Conflict management in both international and civil conflicts will be discussed. Students will learn about negotiation, mediation, arbitration and adjudication, sanctions, military intervention, peacekeeping, nation-building, and the design of peace agreements. We will also talk about the role of the United Nations</span><span class="deschide">, regional organizations, and major powers like the U.S. in conflict management. While the main goal of the class is to familiarize students with central concepts and theories of conflict management, we will also take a look at cases that illustrate when, how and why different strategies work.</span><br/>

This course provides an introduction to game theory and its application in social science, especially political science and economics. The purposes of the course are to give students a sense of the field of game theory and how political scientists use it in making arguments about how government and politics work, to develop students' intuition about strategic situations in everyday life, and to</span><span class="deschide"> develop students' analytical capabilities generally. Upon completion of the course, students will be able to depict social situations as simple game theoretic models, analyze those models to understand how the behaviors of the individuals involved are mutually reinforcing, and apply computer-based tools to evaluate under conditions of uncertainty.</span><br/>

This course examines the interaction between politics and markets, both in theory and in practice, explicitly linking classic works on political economy with current policy debates. We study how political systems and markets are organized in a wide range of different national settings, looking at both history and contemporary issues. Topics include: 1) early industrialization in Britain and the United States, 2) late industrialization in continental</span><span class="deschide"> Europe and Japan, 3) the varieties of capitalism in contemporary industrialized countries, 4) the newly industrializing economics of Latin America and East Asia, 5) the problems of development, and 6) the transition from communism to a market economy in Eastern Europe and China.</span><br/>

This course will examine international migration from a historical and comparative perspective, looking at why people migrate, how citizens respond to the migration, and how states respond to migration. The first part of the course looks at the changing relationship between the state, immigrants, and citizenship. Turning to case studies, we will examine five different types of receiving states, each confronted</span><span class="deschide"> with a different form of migration: a traditional immigrant state, a post-colonial state, a non-traditional immigrant state that imports migrant workers, a highly industrialized latecomer state, and a newly industrialized state.</span><br/>

In the present era political, economic, and social organization powerfully influence national capacity to assure economic success, real and rising incomes for the population, and political success, basic survival, and the projection of its purposes and values. This course looks at the continual process of international competition and transformation, and examines which factors separate the winners from the losers. We will gain leverage into</span><span class="deschide"> these questions by examining critical moments in the 20th and 21st centuries and analyze according to national responses. What choices signal success? Can the failures be avoided? The course will discuss whether globalization is shunting aside national political choice, or whether globalization is in fact a sequence of national and regional stories played out on a larger stage. We will consider how economic constraint structures political choice and national response to the global economy. But we will also examine how political developments shape market dynamics and national innovations. We will learn about all sorts of things from the politics of French fashion to why Japanese make good cars.</span><br/>

These conflicts can lead to violence and hardship. They can also result in creative adaptations and solutions based in political and administrative institutions and processes that build peace.

Throughout the course, students will be introduced to social science and environmental science perspectives.

French political life has long gravitated around a &quot;Republican model&quot; marked by an unmediated relationship between the citizen and the state, socialization into French values through secular public education, a special vocation for France on the international stage, and an activist state.

Students will explore, discuss, and understand the relationship between racial/ethnic group formation, group-based beliefs and behavior, and politics. Our focus is on the US today, but with an appreciation of how the racial politics of the here and now is rooted in history and human psychology. We cover Black Politics, Latinx Politics, Asian American Politics, Native American Politics and White Politics, general concepts of identity, immigration, citizenship, class</span><span class="deschide">, and intersectionality. We examine both how race and ethnicity affect politics, as well as how politics can shape the boundaries, definitions and behaviors of groups. These behaviors include voting, elite decisions, civic engagement, protests, and media content and usage.</span><br/>

Some of the most enduring and violent conflicts in America center on race. The goal of this course is to explore, discuss, and better understand the relationship between perceptions of racial identity, attributions of racial difference, and politics, broadly defined. We focus on the recent and persistent debates about racism, identity, rights, representation, citizenship, conflict, and coalitions. A repeated theme of this course is the question</span><span class="deschide"> whether racial order and inequality are essential to, or an exception from, the liberal democracy in the U.S. This is a lecture course with intensive readings, written assignments, and in-class discussion.</span><br/>

This course explores the way societies try to address and solve difficult and seemingly intractable public problems. Can we attribute success or failure to institutions and their capacity to solve problems? Are problems difficult to solve because they are complex or because of a failure of political will? What are the characteristics of organizations or communities that are able to solve problems? How are public problems framed and how are</span><span class="deschide"> they used to mobilize constituencies? The course draws on literature in public administration, public policy studies, and democratic theory to try to better understand some of the major social, political, environmental, and economic problems of our contemporary world.</span><br/>
