				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The major in Greek provides training in ancient Greek from the ground up, enabling students to encounter texts such as Homer's <em>Odyssey</em>, Sophocles' <em>Antigone, </em>and the dialogues of Plato in their original form.  Students majoring in Greek contextualize these readings by taking classes in Classical Civilizations, where they explore many different aspects of Greek culture and read a broad array of ancient texts in translation.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>The easiest way to declare a major is to meet with an undergraduate advisor, who will have all the necessary forms. Please also see the Letters &amp; Science advising site for a guide to <a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/major/declare.html">declaring a major</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-ce556fc5-39b1-c8d8-58c0-fe5d41970428">Students who are declared majors in Greek and who have a GPA (both general and departmental) of at least 3.6 are eligible for honors in Greek. The honors program consists of a two-semester course sequence — <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195A" title="GREEK H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195A');">GREEK H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195B" title="GREEK H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195B');">GREEK H195B</a></span>, that is designed to support the writing of a thesis. This thesis, which will be evaluated by an honors committee of three members, may either build on work in a previous upper division course used in fulfillment of the Classical Civilizations major or may be a newly conceived project. It is due the Monday of the 13th week of the semester in which Greek H195B is taken. </span>
</p>

<p>Further details can be found online at <a href="http://www.classics.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/honors">Classics Undergraduate Honors</a>. Please consult with a classics undergraduate adviser to begin planning to participate in honors.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Classics offers a minor in Greek Studies. The minor requires five upper division courses in Greek language and related courses. At least three courses must be in the Greek language; up to two courses may be in courses with substantial content relevant to Greek literature, philosophy, culture, or history.  Courses or seminars taught by Classics professors in other departments may also be accepted, in consultation with the Undergraduate Faculty Advisor. One of the five courses may be taken outside of the department on campus or abroad with the approval of the Undergraduate Faculty Advisor.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade.</li>
	<li>Five upper division courses in Greek language and related courses:
	<ul>
		<li>Three courses must be in the Greek language</li>
		<li>Two courses may be in Greek or they may be courses with substantial content relevant to Greek literature, philosophy, culture, or history. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The learning goals should be understood in the context of the <a href="http://www.classics.berkeley.edu/about" target="_blank">mission statement of the Department of Classics</a>. The first two components of that statement are especially relevant to undergraduate teaching and are repeated here:</p>
<ol>
	<li>To give students across the University access to the literature, history, archaeology, mythology and philosophy of the ancient Greek and Roman world through an array of undergraduate courses on classical culture in translation. These courses introduce students to texts, artifacts, and ideas that are worth studying both in their own right and as abidingly influential elements in the imagination and history of later cultures. Such study deepens students' understanding of present-day issues by inculcating a sense of historical perspective that takes into account both the differences and the continuities between contemporary and ancient cultures.</li>
	<li>To enable undergraduates to immerse themselves in the language and culture of ancient Greece and Rome through its majors in Greek, Latin, and Classical Civilizations. These majors equip students with knowledge and analytical skills that can be applied in many areas (e.g., law, politics, business, biosciences, computer science, and media) as well as providing essential preparation for graduate study in Classics, Comparative Literature, Philosophy, and other fields.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Acquire a basic grounding in the vocabulary, morphology, and syntax of classical Greek.</li>
	<li>Practice the skills needed to use dictionaries, grammars, and other resources to read intermediate texts accurately and to deal comfortably with at least some advanced texts in the original language(s).</li>
	<li>Gain a critical awareness of continuities and differences between and within cultures and of ideologies of gender, group identity, social status, and political organization.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to interpret texts and material culture and to understand the implications of interpretive methods.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal English prose.</li>
</ol>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The major in Greek provides training in ancient Greek from the ground up, enabling students to encounter texts such as Homer's <em>Odyssey</em>, Sophocles' <em>Antigone, </em>and the dialogues of Plato in their original form.  Students majoring in Greek contextualize these readings by taking classes in Classical Civilizations, where they explore many different aspects of Greek culture and read a broad array of ancient texts in translation.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>The easiest way to declare a major is to meet with an undergraduate advisor, who will have all the necessary forms. Please also see the Letters &amp; Science advising site for a guide to <a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/major/declare.html">declaring a major</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-ce556fc5-39b1-c8d8-58c0-fe5d41970428">Students who are declared majors in Greek and who have a GPA (both general and departmental) of at least 3.6 are eligible for honors in Greek. The honors program consists of a two-semester course sequence — <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195A" title="GREEK H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195A');">GREEK H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195B" title="GREEK H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195B');">GREEK H195B</a></span>, that is designed to support the writing of a thesis. This thesis, which will be evaluated by an honors committee of three members, may either build on work in a previous upper division course used in fulfillment of the Classical Civilizations major or may be a newly conceived project. It is due the Monday of the 13th week of the semester in which Greek H195B is taken. </span>
</p>

<p>Further details can be found online at <a href="http://www.classics.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/honors">Classics Undergraduate Honors</a>. Please consult with a classics undergraduate adviser to begin planning to participate in honors.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Classics offers a minor in Greek Studies. The minor requires five upper division courses in Greek language and related courses. At least three courses must be in the Greek language; up to two courses may be in courses with substantial content relevant to Greek literature, philosophy, culture, or history.  Courses or seminars taught by Classics professors in other departments may also be accepted, in consultation with the Undergraduate Faculty Advisor. One of the five courses may be taken outside of the department on campus or abroad with the approval of the Undergraduate Faculty Advisor.</p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The learning goals should be understood in the context of the <a href="http://www.classics.berkeley.edu/about" target="_blank">mission statement of the Department of Classics</a>. The first two components of that statement are especially relevant to undergraduate teaching and are repeated here:</p>
<ol>
	<li>To give students across the University access to the literature, history, archaeology, mythology and philosophy of the ancient Greek and Roman world through an array of undergraduate courses on classical culture in translation. These courses introduce students to texts, artifacts, and ideas that are worth studying both in their own right and as abidingly influential elements in the imagination and history of later cultures. Such study deepens students' understanding of present-day issues by inculcating a sense of historical perspective that takes into account both the differences and the continuities between contemporary and ancient cultures.</li>
	<li>To enable undergraduates to immerse themselves in the language and culture of ancient Greece and Rome through its majors in Greek, Latin, and Classical Civilizations. These majors equip students with knowledge and analytical skills that can be applied in many areas (e.g., law, politics, business, biosciences, computer science, and media) as well as providing essential preparation for graduate study in Classics, Comparative Literature, Philosophy, and other fields.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Acquire a basic grounding in the vocabulary, morphology, and syntax of classical Greek.</li>
	<li>Practice the skills needed to use dictionaries, grammars, and other resources to read intermediate texts accurately and to deal comfortably with at least some advanced texts in the original language(s).</li>
	<li>Gain a critical awareness of continuities and differences between and within cultures and of ideologies of gender, group identity, social status, and political organization.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to interpret texts and material culture and to understand the implications of interpretive methods.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal English prose.</li>
</ol>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The major in Greek provides training in ancient Greek from the ground up, enabling students to encounter texts such as Homer's <em>Odyssey</em>, Sophocles' <em>Antigone, </em>and the dialogues of Plato in their original form.  Students majoring in Greek contextualize these readings by taking classes in Classical Civilizations, where they explore many different aspects of Greek culture and read a broad array of ancient texts in translation.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>The easiest way to declare a major is to meet with an undergraduate advisor, who will have all the necessary forms. Please also see the Letters &amp; Science advising site for a guide to <a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/major/declare.html">declaring a major</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-ce556fc5-39b1-c8d8-58c0-fe5d41970428">Students who are declared majors in Greek and who have a GPA (both general and departmental) of at least 3.6 are eligible for honors in Greek. The honors program consists of a two-semester course sequence — <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195A" title="GREEK H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195A');">GREEK H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195B" title="GREEK H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195B');">GREEK H195B</a></span>, that is designed to support the writing of a thesis. This thesis, which will be evaluated by an honors committee of three members, may either build on work in a previous upper division course used in fulfillment of the Classical Civilizations major or may be a newly conceived project. It is due the Monday of the 13th week of the semester in which Greek H195B is taken. </span>
</p>

<p>Further details can be found online at <a href="http://www.classics.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/honors">Classics Undergraduate Honors</a>. Please consult with a classics undergraduate adviser to begin planning to participate in honors.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Classics offers a minor in Greek Studies. The minor requires five upper division courses in Greek language and related courses. At least three courses must be in the Greek language; up to two courses may be in courses with substantial content relevant to Greek literature, philosophy, culture, or history.  Courses or seminars taught by Classics professors in other departments may also be accepted, in consultation with the Undergraduate Faculty Advisor. One of the five courses may be taken outside of the department on campus or abroad with the approval of the Undergraduate Faculty Advisor.</p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The learning goals should be understood in the context of the <a href="http://www.classics.berkeley.edu/about" target="_blank">mission statement of the Department of Classics</a>. The first two components of that statement are especially relevant to undergraduate teaching and are repeated here:</p>
<ol>
	<li>To give students across the University access to the literature, history, archaeology, mythology and philosophy of the ancient Greek and Roman world through an array of undergraduate courses on classical culture in translation. These courses introduce students to texts, artifacts, and ideas that are worth studying both in their own right and as abidingly influential elements in the imagination and history of later cultures. Such study deepens students' understanding of present-day issues by inculcating a sense of historical perspective that takes into account both the differences and the continuities between contemporary and ancient cultures.</li>
	<li>To enable undergraduates to immerse themselves in the language and culture of ancient Greece and Rome through its majors in Greek, Latin, and Classical Civilizations. These majors equip students with knowledge and analytical skills that can be applied in many areas (e.g., law, politics, business, biosciences, computer science, and media) as well as providing essential preparation for graduate study in Classics, Comparative Literature, Philosophy, and other fields.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Acquire a basic grounding in the vocabulary, morphology, and syntax of classical Greek.</li>
	<li>Practice the skills needed to use dictionaries, grammars, and other resources to read intermediate texts accurately and to deal comfortably with at least some advanced texts in the original language(s).</li>
	<li>Gain a critical awareness of continuities and differences between and within cultures and of ideologies of gender, group identity, social status, and political organization.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to interpret texts and material culture and to understand the implications of interpretive methods.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal English prose.</li>
</ol>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The major in Greek provides training in ancient Greek from the ground up, enabling students to encounter texts such as Homer's <em>Odyssey</em>, Sophocles' <em>Antigone, </em>and the dialogues of Plato in their original form.  Students majoring in Greek contextualize these readings by taking classes in Classical Civilizations, where they explore many different aspects of Greek culture and read a broad array of ancient texts in translation.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>The easiest way to declare a major is to meet with an undergraduate advisor, who will have all the necessary forms. Please also see the Letters &amp; Science advising site for a guide to <a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/major/declare.html">declaring a major</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-ce556fc5-39b1-c8d8-58c0-fe5d41970428">Students who are declared majors in Greek and who have a GPA (both general and departmental) of at least 3.6 are eligible for honors in Greek. The honors program consists of a two-semester course sequence — <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195A" title="GREEK H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195A');">GREEK H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195B" title="GREEK H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195B');">GREEK H195B</a></span>, that is designed to support the writing of a thesis. This thesis, which will be evaluated by an honors committee of three members, may either build on work in a previous upper division course used in fulfillment of the Classical Civilizations major or may be a newly conceived project. It is due the Monday of the 13th week of the semester in which Greek H195B is taken. </span>
</p>

<p>Further details can be found online at <a href="http://www.classics.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/honors">Classics Undergraduate Honors</a>. Please consult with a classics undergraduate adviser to begin planning to participate in honors.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Classics offers a minor in Greek Studies. The minor requires five upper division courses in Greek language and related courses. At least three courses must be in the Greek language; up to two courses may be in courses with substantial content relevant to Greek literature, philosophy, culture, or history.  Courses or seminars taught by Classics professors in other departments may also be accepted, in consultation with the Undergraduate Faculty Advisor. One of the five courses may be taken outside of the department on campus or abroad with the approval of the Undergraduate Faculty Advisor.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade.</li>
	<li>Five upper division courses in Greek language and related courses:
	<ul>
		<li>Three courses must be in the Greek language</li>
		<li>Two courses may be in Greek or they may be courses with substantial content relevant to Greek literature, philosophy, culture, or history. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The learning goals should be understood in the context of the <a href="http://www.classics.berkeley.edu/about" target="_blank">mission statement of the Department of Classics</a>. The first two components of that statement are especially relevant to undergraduate teaching and are repeated here:</p>
<ol>
	<li>To give students across the University access to the literature, history, archaeology, mythology and philosophy of the ancient Greek and Roman world through an array of undergraduate courses on classical culture in translation. These courses introduce students to texts, artifacts, and ideas that are worth studying both in their own right and as abidingly influential elements in the imagination and history of later cultures. Such study deepens students' understanding of present-day issues by inculcating a sense of historical perspective that takes into account both the differences and the continuities between contemporary and ancient cultures.</li>
	<li>To enable undergraduates to immerse themselves in the language and culture of ancient Greece and Rome through its majors in Greek, Latin, and Classical Civilizations. These majors equip students with knowledge and analytical skills that can be applied in many areas (e.g., law, politics, business, biosciences, computer science, and media) as well as providing essential preparation for graduate study in Classics, Comparative Literature, Philosophy, and other fields.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Acquire a basic grounding in the vocabulary, morphology, and syntax of classical Greek.</li>
	<li>Practice the skills needed to use dictionaries, grammars, and other resources to read intermediate texts accurately and to deal comfortably with at least some advanced texts in the original language(s).</li>
	<li>Gain a critical awareness of continuities and differences between and within cultures and of ideologies of gender, group identity, social status, and political organization.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to interpret texts and material culture and to understand the implications of interpretive methods.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal English prose.</li>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The major in Greek provides training in ancient Greek from the ground up, enabling students to encounter texts such as Homer's <em>Odyssey</em>, Sophocles' <em>Antigone, </em>and the dialogues of Plato in their original form.  Students majoring in Greek contextualize these readings by taking classes in Classical Civilizations, where they explore many different aspects of Greek culture and read a broad array of ancient texts in translation.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>The easiest way to declare a major is to meet with an undergraduate advisor, who will have all the necessary forms. Please also see the Letters &amp; Science advising site for a guide to <a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/major/declare.html">declaring a major</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-ce556fc5-39b1-c8d8-58c0-fe5d41970428">Students who are declared majors in Greek and who have a GPA (both general and departmental) of at least 3.6 are eligible for honors in Greek. The honors program consists of a two-semester course sequence — <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195A" title="GREEK H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195A');">GREEK H195A</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=GREEK%20H195B" title="GREEK H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'GREEK H195B');">GREEK H195B</a></span>, that is designed to support the writing of a thesis. This thesis, which will be evaluated by an honors committee of three members, may either build on work in a previous upper division course used in fulfillment of the Classical Civilizations major or may be a newly conceived project. It is due the Monday of the 13th week of the semester in which Greek H195B is taken. </span>
</p>

<p>Further details can be found online at <a href="http://www.classics.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/honors">Classics Undergraduate Honors</a>. Please consult with a classics undergraduate adviser to begin planning to participate in honors.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Classics offers a minor in Greek Studies. The minor requires five upper division courses in Greek language and related courses. At least three courses must be in the Greek language; up to two courses may be in courses with substantial content relevant to Greek literature, philosophy, culture, or history.  Courses or seminars taught by Classics professors in other departments may also be accepted, in consultation with the Undergraduate Faculty Advisor. One of the five courses may be taken outside of the department on campus or abroad with the approval of the Undergraduate Faculty Advisor.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade.</li>
	<li>Five upper division courses in Greek language and related courses:
	<ul>
		<li>Three courses must be in the Greek language</li>
		<li>Two courses may be in Greek or they may be courses with substantial content relevant to Greek literature, philosophy, culture, or history. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements tab.)</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The learning goals should be understood in the context of the <a href="http://www.classics.berkeley.edu/about" target="_blank">mission statement of the Department of Classics</a>. The first two components of that statement are especially relevant to undergraduate teaching and are repeated here:</p>
<ol>
	<li>To give students across the University access to the literature, history, archaeology, mythology and philosophy of the ancient Greek and Roman world through an array of undergraduate courses on classical culture in translation. These courses introduce students to texts, artifacts, and ideas that are worth studying both in their own right and as abidingly influential elements in the imagination and history of later cultures. Such study deepens students' understanding of present-day issues by inculcating a sense of historical perspective that takes into account both the differences and the continuities between contemporary and ancient cultures.</li>
	<li>To enable undergraduates to immerse themselves in the language and culture of ancient Greece and Rome through its majors in Greek, Latin, and Classical Civilizations. These majors equip students with knowledge and analytical skills that can be applied in many areas (e.g., law, politics, business, biosciences, computer science, and media) as well as providing essential preparation for graduate study in Classics, Comparative Literature, Philosophy, and other fields.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Acquire a basic grounding in the vocabulary, morphology, and syntax of classical Greek.</li>
	<li>Practice the skills needed to use dictionaries, grammars, and other resources to read intermediate texts accurately and to deal comfortably with at least some advanced texts in the original language(s).</li>
	<li>Gain a critical awareness of continuities and differences between and within cultures and of ideologies of gender, group identity, social status, and political organization.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to interpret texts and material culture and to understand the implications of interpretive methods.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal English prose.</li>
</ol>
