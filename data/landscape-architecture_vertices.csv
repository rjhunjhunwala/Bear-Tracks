The course stresses motives and values expressed through environmental design at various scales – from neighborhood to global and examines problems affecting healthy"
LD ARCH 133,1,"This course will provide students an opportunity to analyze and interpret the iconic built landscapes of the Bay Area through direct observation and field sketching. The vision for the course is influenced by the global popularity of the Urban Sketchers movement, a phenomenon based on personal engagement with one’s environment. The annotated sketchbook will be used as the primary tool for investigation and documentation of core fundamental principles and elements of"
LD ARCH 134A,1,"This studio will elaborate on a number of studio themes while introducing the students to a variety of graphic mediums and drawing techniques. Measured drawing procedures (including orthographic projections) will be augmented by figure-ground principles and themes of contrast, color, chiaroscuro, and compositions. On-site and visits to galleries and museums will complement the studio sessions."
LD ARCH 134B,1,"This course introduces students to digital tools relevant to the discipline of landscape architecture.
