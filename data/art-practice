				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts</h3>
<p>The UC Berkeley Department of Art Practice offers an undergraduate program in studio art which provides a firm grounding in basic techniques and principles while encouraging guided experimentation. Our curriculum is designed to develop critical understandings across a broad range of media and disciplines. We provide technical and conceptual training in most traditional and new media: painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture (wood, metal, ceramic, and mixed media), photography, installation, performance art, video, animation, sound, and in the emerging fields of programming, interactivity, game design, and AR/VR. Art Majors are expected to round out the required studio courses with Art History and Theory classes.</p>
<p>Art Practice seeks to graduate students with potential for significant artistic and cultural impact. Successful Art Practice graduates understand the professional art world and are articulate about their work. They are deeply engaged with their art forms, rigorously committed to their craft, and highly capable of invigorating conceptual, technical, and critical creative research. Students graduating with a major in art pursue careers as professional artists and teachers, or in arts-related activities with museums, galleries, arts management, publishing, and artists’ organizations.</p>
<h3>Course of Study Overview</h3>
<p>While the undergraduate major is made up largely of studio courses, it also requires at least three courses in art history. Our students are required to be broadly familiar with the aesthetic strategies that artists have devised to understand and invent their worlds, not just in the 20th and 21st centuries, but throughout the millennia of human culture. Field trips to area museums, galleries, and artists’ studios provide an important onsite learning tool, one which emphasizes the pedagogical primacy of direct contact with works of art.</p>
<p>Small studio classes with frequent critiques are designed to foster a supportive community, productive debate, and collaborative thinking. Students are encouraged to be both open-minded and tough-minded, to look closely, think critically, and challenge assumptions. Most upper division studio courses involve an exhibition requirement when students are asked to consider questions of audience, context, site, and timing. Several gallery spaces, among them the Worth Ryder Art Gallery, offer exhibition venues. The department also maintains web space for online exhibitions and video streaming.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>In order to declare the major, you must:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have an overall GPA of 3.3.</li>
	<li>Complete the R&amp;C requirements.</li>
	<li>Complete two required studio classes: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ART%208" title="ART 8" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ART 8');">ART 8</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ART%2012" title="ART 12" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ART 12');">ART 12</a></span> and one lower division History of Art course (any).</li>

	<li>Submit a portfolio of 12 images (include work from all UC Berkeley studio classes).</li>
	<li>Submit one letter of recommendation from an art faculty, art lecturer, or art GSI.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with an overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 or higher who are in their senior year may, with the permission of a regular faculty member, enroll in the honors program. This is an independent study course, taken for a minimum of one semester and a maximum of two semesters and comprising a minimum of 4 units and a maximum of 8 units. A final grade is given at the completion of the program. Honors courses count toward the art major as they are taken for a letter grade.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://art.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs, with the exception of minors offered outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>

This studio course investigates representations of the human body across different periods and locations to further what it means to depict the body in the 21st Century. How do dominant signifiers and various intersections of race, gender, class, religion, sexuality, and disability influence the rendering and image reception of human bodies? The studio component of the course will work from live models as well as creating</span><span class="deschide"> full body self-portraits that challenge the parameters of the canon and conventional expectations.

This practice and theory course provides interdisciplinary perspectives from new media, anthropology, religious studies, and sociology to read cultural expressions--from religious behavior and rituals, to speech acts, and political action. We will read theoretical texts, look at art, and produce performances and videos. We will create installation environments for live performances, generate 360º video, and build VR platforms to explore the boundaries between the virtual</span><span class="deschide"> and real worlds. The class goal is to develop critical and self-reflexive approaches to video and performance art production as a laboratory to reimagine community, citizenship, power and responsibility, and to produce new ontologies and new modes of being in this world.<br/></span><br/>

Motion is a ubiquitous element of human experience, yet attempts to explain it remain incomplete.

In this production-intensive studio course, we will study</span><span class="deschide"> computer graphics for motion simulations, or animations. We will also probe these tools for their use in creative expression and analyze their impact on our own perception of motion. Software used: Maya.

This course offers an introduction to game design and game studies. Game studies has five core elements: the study of games as transmitters of culture, the study of play and interactivity, the study of games as symbolic systems; the study of games as artifacts; and methods for creating games. We will study these core elements through play, play tests, play analysis, and comparative studies. Our reading list includes classic game studies theory</span><span class="deschide"> and texts which support game design methods. After weekly writing and design exercises, our coursework will culminate in the design and evaluation of an original code-based game with a tangible interface.</span><br/>
