				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Berkeley electrical engineering and computer sciences major (EECS), offered through the College of Engineering, combines fundamentals of computer science and electrical engineering in one major.</p>
<p>Note that students wishing to study<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Programs/two_ways.html"> computer science</a> at UC Berkeley have two different major options: The EECS major leads to the Bachelor of Science (BS), while the the College of Letters &amp; Sciences offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree.  An essential difference between the two majors is that the EECS program requires a greater number of math and science courses than the CS program, which requires a greater number of non-technical, or breadth, courses. For further information on the BA program, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/computer-science/">Computer Science program page in this Guide</a>. </p>
<p>After completing the required lower division courses, students in the EECS major are able to pursue coursework in computer science and/or electrical engineering based on their personal interests. As they approach graduation, students will be asked to select from one of two programs: electrical and computer engineering (ECE) or computer science and engineering (CSE), depending on their chosen area of concentration. This option is indicated on the student's transcript once their degree is conferred. </p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>All UC Berkeley programs are accredited through the Accrediting Commission for Schools, Western Association of Schools and Colleges (ACS WASC).</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The EECS honors degree program is designed to provide very talented undergraduate students a greater connection to the department. Honors students pursue undergraduate research and select an academic concentration outside of EECS. In addition, students receive a special faculty adviser, engage in research, receive official notation of the honors degree on their Berkeley transcript, and are invited to special events with faculty and EECS honors alumni.</p>
<p>For more information regarding this program, please click<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/education/degrees.shtml#honors"> here.</a></p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering apply to a specific major within the college. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Change of College applications are not accepted for matriculated students in other colleges wishing to declare the EECS major. Prospective undergraduates interested in an EECS major must apply for admission to the College of Engineering.  </p>
<h3>Five-Year BS/MS Program</h3>
<p>The Five-Year Bachelor/Master Program, called the 5th Year MS Program for short, offers qualified EECS and L&amp;S Computer Science undergraduate students a unique opportunity to begin graduate study during their undergraduate years, thereby accelerating the master's degree by requiring only one additional year beyond the bachelor's degree. This is not a concurrent degree program. Students earn their bachelor's degree first and then the master's. However, careful planning during the undergraduate program allows motivated students to begin a research project and complete some master's course requirements while still in undergraduate standing. Depending on how quickly a student progresses through the undergraduate program, the additional graduate year may come sooner than the fifth year at Berkeley. The Five-Year Program is not intended for those who wish to pursue a PhD. For further information regarding this program, please see the Five-Year BS/MS tab on this page or the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/FiveYearMS/">Department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The EECS minor, offered through the College of Engineering, is an optional program for students interested in coherent EECS study outside of their major. It is open to any undergraduate who has declared a major other than EECS and has completed four of the course requirements. For further information regarding the requirements and declaration process, please see the Minor Requirements tab.</p>
<p>The EECS Department also offers a minor in computer science. For information regarding this program, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/computer-science/">computer science program page in this Guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Joint Majors</h3>
<p>The EECS Department also offers two joint majors with other departments in the College of Engineering. For further information on these programs, please click the links below:<br/>

				<a name="fiveyearbsmstext"></a><h2>Five-Year BS/MS</h2><p><span>The Five-Year Bachelor/Master Program, called the 5th Year MS Program for short, offers qualified EECS and L&amp;S Computer Science undergraduate students a unique opportunity to begin graduate study during their undergraduate years, thereby accelerating the master's degree by requiring only one additional year beyond the bachelor's degree. This is not a concurrent degree program. Students earn their bachelor's degree first and then the master's. However, careful planning during the undergraduate program allows motivated students to begin a research project and complete some master's course requirements while still in undergraduate standing. Depending on how quickly a student progresses through the undergraduate program, the additional graduate year may come sooner than the fifth year at Berkeley. The five-year program is not intended for those who wish to pursue a PhD. For further information regarding this program, please see the </span><a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/FiveYearMS/" target="_blank">Department's website</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well. It is not intended for students who have definitely decided to pursue a PhD immediately following graduation. Those students are advised to apply for a PhD program at Berkeley or elsewhere during their senior year. Students who have been accepted into the five-year BA/MS or BS/MS are free to change their minds later and apply to enter the PhD program or apply to a PhD program at another university. Note that admission is competitive with all our PhD applicants.</p>
<p>The program is focused on interdisciplinary training at a graduate level; with at least 8 units of course work outside EECS required. Students will emerge as leaders in their technical and professional fields.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Focused on interdisciplinary study and more experience in aligned technical fields such as physics, materials science, statistics, biology, etc., and/or professional disciplines such as management of technology, business, law and public policy.</li>
	<li>If admitted to the program, students must begin the graduate portion in the semester immediately following the conferral of the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only one additional year (two semesters) is permitted beyond the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only available to Berkeley EECS and L&amp;S CS undergraduates.</li>
	<li>Participants in program may serve as graduate student instructors with approval from their faculty research advisor and the 5th Year MS Committee.</li>
	<li>Participants in program are self-funded.</li>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. Colleges typically do not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>Students do not need to be in the College of Engineering to pursue the EECS minor. </p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>​All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed with a letter grade.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required to apply for the minor.  </span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>

You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework.

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> C8R also includes quantitative reasoning concepts that aren’t covered in Data 8. These include certain topics in: principles of data visualization; simulation of random processes; and understanding numerical functions through their graphs. This will help prepare students for computational and quantitative courses other than Data 8.<br/>C8R takes advantage of the complementarity of computing and quantitative reasoning to enliven abstract ideas and build students’ confidence in their ability to solve real problems with quantitative tools. Students learn computer science concepts and immediately apply them to plot functions, visualize data, and simulate random events.<br/>
<br/>Foundations of Data Science (CS/Info/Stat C8, a.k.a. Data 8) is an increasingly popular class for entering students at Berkeley. Data 8 builds students’ computing skills in the first month of the semester, and students rely on these skills as the course progresses. For some students, particularly those with little prior exposure to computing, developing these skills benefits from further time and practice. C8R is a rapid introduction to Python programming, visualization, and data analysis, which will prepare students for success in Data 8.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will be able to perform basic computations in Python, including working with tabular data.<br/>
Students will be able to understand basic probabilistic simulations.<br/>
Students will be able to understand the syntactic structure of Python code.<br/>
Students will be able to use good practices in Python programming.<br/>
Students will be able to use visualizations to understand univariate data and to identify associations or causal relationships in bivariate data.</p></div>

Cryptography or cryptology is the science of designing algorithms and protocols for enabling parties to communicate and compute securely in an untrusted environment (e.g. secure communication, digital signature, etc.) Over the last four decades, cryptography has transformed from an ad hoc collection of mysterious tricks into a rigorous science based on firm complexity-theoretic foundations. This modern complexity-theoretic</span><span class="deschide"> approach to cryptography will be the focus. E.g., in the context of encryption we will begin by giving a precise mathematical definition for what it means to be a secure encryption scheme and then give a construction (realizing this security notion) assuming various computational hardness assumptions (e.g. factoring).</span><br/>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis</span><span class="deschide">, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Berkeley electrical engineering and computer sciences major (EECS), offered through the College of Engineering, combines fundamentals of computer science and electrical engineering in one major.</p>
<p>Note that students wishing to study<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Programs/two_ways.html"> computer science</a> at UC Berkeley have two different major options: The EECS major leads to the Bachelor of Science (BS), while the the College of Letters &amp; Sciences offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree.  An essential difference between the two majors is that the EECS program requires a greater number of math and science courses than the CS program, which requires a greater number of non-technical, or breadth, courses. For further information on the BA program, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/computer-science/">Computer Science program page in this Guide</a>. </p>
<p>After completing the required lower division courses, students in the EECS major are able to pursue coursework in computer science and/or electrical engineering based on their personal interests. As they approach graduation, students will be asked to select from one of two programs: electrical and computer engineering (ECE) or computer science and engineering (CSE), depending on their chosen area of concentration. This option is indicated on the student's transcript once their degree is conferred. </p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>All UC Berkeley programs are accredited through the Accrediting Commission for Schools, Western Association of Schools and Colleges (ACS WASC).</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The EECS honors degree program is designed to provide very talented undergraduate students a greater connection to the department. Honors students pursue undergraduate research and select an academic concentration outside of EECS. In addition, students receive a special faculty adviser, engage in research, receive official notation of the honors degree on their Berkeley transcript, and are invited to special events with faculty and EECS honors alumni.</p>
<p>For more information regarding this program, please click<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/education/degrees.shtml#honors"> here.</a></p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering apply to a specific major within the college. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Change of College applications are not accepted for matriculated students in other colleges wishing to declare the EECS major. Prospective undergraduates interested in an EECS major must apply for admission to the College of Engineering.  </p>
<h3>Five-Year BS/MS Program</h3>
<p>The Five-Year Bachelor/Master Program, called the 5th Year MS Program for short, offers qualified EECS and L&amp;S Computer Science undergraduate students a unique opportunity to begin graduate study during their undergraduate years, thereby accelerating the master's degree by requiring only one additional year beyond the bachelor's degree. This is not a concurrent degree program. Students earn their bachelor's degree first and then the master's. However, careful planning during the undergraduate program allows motivated students to begin a research project and complete some master's course requirements while still in undergraduate standing. Depending on how quickly a student progresses through the undergraduate program, the additional graduate year may come sooner than the fifth year at Berkeley. The Five-Year Program is not intended for those who wish to pursue a PhD. For further information regarding this program, please see the Five-Year BS/MS tab on this page or the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/FiveYearMS/">Department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The EECS minor, offered through the College of Engineering, is an optional program for students interested in coherent EECS study outside of their major. It is open to any undergraduate who has declared a major other than EECS and has completed four of the course requirements. For further information regarding the requirements and declaration process, please see the Minor Requirements tab.</p>

				<a name="fiveyearbsmstext"></a><h2>Five-Year BS/MS</h2><p><span>The Five-Year Bachelor/Master Program, called the 5th Year MS Program for short, offers qualified EECS and L&amp;S Computer Science undergraduate students a unique opportunity to begin graduate study during their undergraduate years, thereby accelerating the master's degree by requiring only one additional year beyond the bachelor's degree. This is not a concurrent degree program. Students earn their bachelor's degree first and then the master's. However, careful planning during the undergraduate program allows motivated students to begin a research project and complete some master's course requirements while still in undergraduate standing. Depending on how quickly a student progresses through the undergraduate program, the additional graduate year may come sooner than the fifth year at Berkeley. The five-year program is not intended for those who wish to pursue a PhD. For further information regarding this program, please see the </span><a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/FiveYearMS/" target="_blank">Department's website</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well. It is not intended for students who have definitely decided to pursue a PhD immediately following graduation. Those students are advised to apply for a PhD program at Berkeley or elsewhere during their senior year. Students who have been accepted into the five-year BA/MS or BS/MS are free to change their minds later and apply to enter the PhD program or apply to a PhD program at another university. Note that admission is competitive with all our PhD applicants.</p>
<p>The program is focused on interdisciplinary training at a graduate level; with at least 8 units of course work outside EECS required. Students will emerge as leaders in their technical and professional fields.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Focused on interdisciplinary study and more experience in aligned technical fields such as physics, materials science, statistics, biology, etc., and/or professional disciplines such as management of technology, business, law and public policy.</li>
	<li>If admitted to the program, students must begin the graduate portion in the semester immediately following the conferral of the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only one additional year (two semesters) is permitted beyond the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only available to Berkeley EECS and L&amp;S CS undergraduates.</li>
	<li>Participants in program may serve as graduate student instructors with approval from their faculty research advisor and the 5th Year MS Committee.</li>
	<li>Participants in program are self-funded.</li>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. Colleges typically do not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>Students do not need to be in the College of Engineering to pursue the EECS minor. </p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>​All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed with a letter grade.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required to apply for the minor.  </span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>L&amp;S Computer Science majors are discouraged from pursuing the EECS minor due to </span>redundancy<span> in </span>curriculum<span>. They may only use EE or EECS upper division courses towards the EECS minor and may not overlap any upper division courses between their major and minor.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>Student must submit the<a href="https://berkeley.app.box.com/s/cxr67xfrprany6z9k8577bbakk0rum1w" target="_blank"> Minor Declaration Form</a> once they have four or more of the minor requirements completed, and at least one semester prior to graduation.</li>
	<li>
	<p>All students must submit the <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/media-inline/fillable_eecs_minor_completion_form_2017.pdf" target="_blank">EECS Minor Completion Form</a>, signed by their Major or ESS Advisor, during their final semester.</p>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement. These courses focus upon how the diversity of America's constituent cultural traditions have shaped and continue to shape American identity and experience.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Visit the </span><a href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a> or the <a href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/">American Cultures website</a> for the specific American Cultures courses offered each semester. For a complete list of approved American Cultures courses at UC Berkeley and California Community Colleges, please see the <a href="https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/amcult">American Cultures Subcommittee’s website</a>.

Data 8 builds students’ computing skills in the first month of the semester, and students rely on these skills as the course progresses. For some students, particularly those with little prior exposure to computing, developing these skills benefits from further time and practice. C8R is a rapid introduction to Python programming, visualization, and data analysis, which will prepare students for success in Data 8.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will be able to perform basic computations in Python, including working with tabular data.<br/>
Students will be able to understand basic probabilistic simulations.<br/>
Students will be able to understand the syntactic structure of Python code.<br/>
Students will be able to use good practices in Python programming.<br/>
Students will be able to use visualizations to understand univariate data and to identify associations or causal relationships in bivariate data.</p></div>

Cryptography or cryptology is the science of designing algorithms and protocols for enabling parties to communicate and compute securely in an untrusted environment (e.g. secure communication, digital signature, etc.) Over the last four decades, cryptography has transformed from an ad hoc collection of mysterious tricks into a rigorous science based on firm complexity-theoretic foundations. This modern complexity-theoretic</span><span class="deschide"> approach to cryptography will be the focus. E.g., in the context of encryption we will begin by giving a precise mathematical definition for what it means to be a secure encryption scheme and then give a construction (realizing this security notion) assuming various computational hardness assumptions (e.g. factoring).</span><br/>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis</span><span class="deschide">, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Berkeley electrical engineering and computer sciences major (EECS), offered through the College of Engineering, combines fundamentals of computer science and electrical engineering in one major.</p>
<p>Note that students wishing to study<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Programs/two_ways.html"> computer science</a> at UC Berkeley have two different major options: The EECS major leads to the Bachelor of Science (BS), while the the College of Letters &amp; Sciences offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree.  An essential difference between the two majors is that the EECS program requires a greater number of math and science courses than the CS program, which requires a greater number of non-technical, or breadth, courses. For further information on the BA program, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/computer-science/">Computer Science program page in this Guide</a>. </p>
<p>After completing the required lower division courses, students in the EECS major are able to pursue coursework in computer science and/or electrical engineering based on their personal interests. As they approach graduation, students will be asked to select from one of two programs: electrical and computer engineering (ECE) or computer science and engineering (CSE), depending on their chosen area of concentration. This option is indicated on the student's transcript once their degree is conferred. </p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>All UC Berkeley programs are accredited through the Accrediting Commission for Schools, Western Association of Schools and Colleges (ACS WASC).</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The EECS honors degree program is designed to provide very talented undergraduate students a greater connection to the department. Honors students pursue undergraduate research and select an academic concentration outside of EECS. In addition, students receive a special faculty adviser, engage in research, receive official notation of the honors degree on their Berkeley transcript, and are invited to special events with faculty and EECS honors alumni.</p>
<p>For more information regarding this program, please click<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/education/degrees.shtml#honors"> here.</a></p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering apply to a specific major within the college. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Change of College applications are not accepted for matriculated students in other colleges wishing to declare the EECS major. Prospective undergraduates interested in an EECS major must apply for admission to the College of Engineering.  </p>
<h3>Five-Year BS/MS Program</h3>
<p>The Five-Year Bachelor/Master Program, called the 5th Year MS Program for short, offers qualified EECS and L&amp;S Computer Science undergraduate students a unique opportunity to begin graduate study during their undergraduate years, thereby accelerating the master's degree by requiring only one additional year beyond the bachelor's degree. This is not a concurrent degree program. Students earn their bachelor's degree first and then the master's. However, careful planning during the undergraduate program allows motivated students to begin a research project and complete some master's course requirements while still in undergraduate standing. Depending on how quickly a student progresses through the undergraduate program, the additional graduate year may come sooner than the fifth year at Berkeley. The Five-Year Program is not intended for those who wish to pursue a PhD. For further information regarding this program, please see the Five-Year BS/MS tab on this page or the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/FiveYearMS/">Department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The EECS minor, offered through the College of Engineering, is an optional program for students interested in coherent EECS study outside of their major. It is open to any undergraduate who has declared a major other than EECS and has completed four of the course requirements. For further information regarding the requirements and declaration process, please see the Minor Requirements tab.</p>
<p>The EECS Department also offers a minor in computer science. For information regarding this program, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/computer-science/">computer science program page in this Guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Joint Majors</h3>
<p>The EECS Department also offers two joint majors with other departments in the College of Engineering. For further information on these programs, please click the links below:<br/>

				<a name="fiveyearbsmstext"></a><h2>Five-Year BS/MS</h2><p><span>The Five-Year Bachelor/Master Program, called the 5th Year MS Program for short, offers qualified EECS and L&amp;S Computer Science undergraduate students a unique opportunity to begin graduate study during their undergraduate years, thereby accelerating the master's degree by requiring only one additional year beyond the bachelor's degree. This is not a concurrent degree program. Students earn their bachelor's degree first and then the master's. However, careful planning during the undergraduate program allows motivated students to begin a research project and complete some master's course requirements while still in undergraduate standing. Depending on how quickly a student progresses through the undergraduate program, the additional graduate year may come sooner than the fifth year at Berkeley. The five-year program is not intended for those who wish to pursue a PhD. For further information regarding this program, please see the </span><a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/FiveYearMS/" target="_blank">Department's website</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well. It is not intended for students who have definitely decided to pursue a PhD immediately following graduation. Those students are advised to apply for a PhD program at Berkeley or elsewhere during their senior year. Students who have been accepted into the five-year BA/MS or BS/MS are free to change their minds later and apply to enter the PhD program or apply to a PhD program at another university. Note that admission is competitive with all our PhD applicants.</p>
<p>The program is focused on interdisciplinary training at a graduate level; with at least 8 units of course work outside EECS required. Students will emerge as leaders in their technical and professional fields.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Focused on interdisciplinary study and more experience in aligned technical fields such as physics, materials science, statistics, biology, etc., and/or professional disciplines such as management of technology, business, law and public policy.</li>
	<li>If admitted to the program, students must begin the graduate portion in the semester immediately following the conferral of the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only one additional year (two semesters) is permitted beyond the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only available to Berkeley EECS and L&amp;S CS undergraduates.</li>
	<li>Participants in program may serve as graduate student instructors with approval from their faculty research advisor and the 5th Year MS Committee.</li>
	<li>Participants in program are self-funded.</li>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. Colleges typically do not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>Students do not need to be in the College of Engineering to pursue the EECS minor. </p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>​All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed with a letter grade.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required to apply for the minor.  </span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>L&amp;S Computer Science majors are discouraged from pursuing the EECS minor due to </span>redundancy<span> in </span>curriculum<span>. They may only use EE or EECS upper division courses towards the EECS minor and may not overlap any upper division courses between their major and minor.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>Student must submit the<a href="https://berkeley.app.box.com/s/cxr67xfrprany6z9k8577bbakk0rum1w" target="_blank"> Minor Declaration Form</a> once they have four or more of the minor requirements completed, and at least one semester prior to graduation.</li>
	<li>
	<p>All students must submit the <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/media-inline/fillable_eecs_minor_completion_form_2017.pdf" target="_blank">EECS Minor Completion Form</a>, signed by their Major or ESS Advisor, during their final semester.</p>

Satisfaction of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all Reading and Composition courses at UC Berkeley.</p> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#universityrequirementstext">American History and American Institutions</a></p> <p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a U.S. resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p> <h3>Campus Requirement</h3> <p><a href="http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/education/#campusrequirementstext">American Cultures</a></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">The American Cultures requirement and courses constitute an approach that responds directly to the problem encountered in numerous disciplines of how better to present the diversity of American experience to the diversity of American students whom we now educate.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Faculty members from many departments teach American Cultures courses, but all courses have a common framework. The courses focus on themes or issues in United States history, society, or culture; address theoretical or analytical issues relevant to understanding race, culture, and ethnicity in American society; take substantial account of groups drawn from at least three of the following: African Americans, indigenous peoples of the United States, Asian Americans, Chicano/Latino Americans, and European Americans; and are integrative and comparative in that students study each group in the larger context of American society, history, or culture.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">This is not an ethnic studies requirement, nor a Third World cultures requirement, nor an adjusted Western civilization requirement. These courses focus upon how the diversity of America's constituent cultural traditions have shaped and continue to shape American identity and experience.</span></p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-27b72187-7fff-bb57-b726-cde72f50c10c">Visit the </span><a href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a> or the <a href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/">American Cultures website</a> for the specific American Cultures courses offered each semester. For a complete list of approved American Cultures courses at UC Berkeley and California Community Colleges, please see the <a href="https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/committees/amcult">American Cultures Subcommittee’s website</a>.

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> C8R also includes quantitative reasoning concepts that aren’t covered in Data 8. These include certain topics in: principles of data visualization; simulation of random processes; and understanding numerical functions through their graphs. This will help prepare students for computational and quantitative courses other than Data 8.<br/>C8R takes advantage of the complementarity of computing and quantitative reasoning to enliven abstract ideas and build students’ confidence in their ability to solve real problems with quantitative tools. Students learn computer science concepts and immediately apply them to plot functions, visualize data, and simulate random events.<br/>
<br/>Foundations of Data Science (CS/Info/Stat C8, a.k.a. Data 8) is an increasingly popular class for entering students at Berkeley. Data 8 builds students’ computing skills in the first month of the semester, and students rely on these skills as the course progresses. For some students, particularly those with little prior exposure to computing, developing these skills benefits from further time and practice. C8R is a rapid introduction to Python programming, visualization, and data analysis, which will prepare students for success in Data 8.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will be able to perform basic computations in Python, including working with tabular data.<br/>
Students will be able to understand basic probabilistic simulations.<br/>
Students will be able to understand the syntactic structure of Python code.<br/>
Students will be able to use good practices in Python programming.<br/>

Cryptography or cryptology is the science of designing algorithms and protocols for enabling parties to communicate and compute securely in an untrusted environment (e.g. secure communication, digital signature, etc.) Over the last four decades, cryptography has transformed from an ad hoc collection of mysterious tricks into a rigorous science based on firm complexity-theoretic foundations. This modern complexity-theoretic</span><span class="deschide"> approach to cryptography will be the focus. E.g., in the context of encryption we will begin by giving a precise mathematical definition for what it means to be a secure encryption scheme and then give a construction (realizing this security notion) assuming various computational hardness assumptions (e.g. factoring).</span><br/>

Deep Networks have revolutionized computer vision, language technology, robotics and control. They have growing impact in many other areas of science and engineering. They do not however, follow a closed or compact set of theoretical principles. In Yann Lecun's words they require &quot;an interplay between intuitive insights, theoretical modeling,<br/>
practical implementations, empirical studies, and scientific</span><span class="deschide"> analyses.&quot; This course attempts to cover that ground.</span><br/>

Biomedical imaging is a clinically important application of engineering, applied mathematics, physics, and medicine. In this course, we apply linear systems theory and basic physics to analyze X-ray imaging, computerized tomography, nuclear medicine, and MRI. We cover the basic physics and instrumentation that characterizes medical image as an ideal perfect-resolution image blurred by an impulse</span><span class="deschide"> response. This material could prepare the student for a career in designing new medical imaging systems that reliably detect small tumors or infarcts.</span><br/>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis</span><span class="deschide">, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br/>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Berkeley electrical engineering and computer sciences major (EECS), offered through the College of Engineering, combines fundamentals of computer science and electrical engineering in one major.</p>
<p>Note that students wishing to study<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Programs/two_ways.html"> computer science</a> at UC Berkeley have two different major options: The EECS major leads to the Bachelor of Science (BS), while the the College of Letters &amp; Sciences offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree.  An essential difference between the two majors is that the EECS program requires a greater number of math and science courses than the CS program, which requires a greater number of non-technical, or breadth, courses. For further information on the BA program, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/computer-science/">Computer Science program page in this Guide</a>. </p>
<p>After completing the required lower division courses, students in the EECS major are able to pursue coursework in computer science and/or electrical engineering based on their personal interests. As they approach graduation, students will be asked to select from one of two programs: electrical and computer engineering (ECE) or computer science and engineering (CSE), depending on their chosen area of concentration. This option is indicated on the student's transcript once their degree is conferred. </p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>All UC Berkeley programs are accredited through the Accrediting Commission for Schools, Western Association of Schools and Colleges (ACS WASC).</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The EECS honors degree program is designed to provide very talented undergraduate students a greater connection to the department. Honors students pursue undergraduate research and select an academic concentration outside of EECS. In addition, students receive a special faculty adviser, engage in research, receive official notation of the honors degree on their Berkeley transcript, and are invited to special events with faculty and EECS honors alumni.</p>
<p>For more information regarding this program, please click<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/education/degrees.shtml#honors"> here.</a></p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering apply to a specific major within the college. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Change of College applications are not accepted for matriculated students in other colleges wishing to declare the EECS major. Prospective undergraduates interested in an EECS major must apply for admission to the College of Engineering.  </p>
<h3>Five-Year BS/MS Program</h3>
<p>The Five-Year Bachelor/Master Program, called the 5th Year MS Program for short, offers qualified EECS and L&amp;S Computer Science undergraduate students a unique opportunity to begin graduate study during their undergraduate years, thereby accelerating the master's degree by requiring only one additional year beyond the bachelor's degree. This is not a concurrent degree program. Students earn their bachelor's degree first and then the master's. However, careful planning during the undergraduate program allows motivated students to begin a research project and complete some master's course requirements while still in undergraduate standing. Depending on how quickly a student progresses through the undergraduate program, the additional graduate year may come sooner than the fifth year at Berkeley. The Five-Year Program is not intended for those who wish to pursue a PhD. For further information regarding this program, please see the Five-Year BS/MS tab on this page or the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/FiveYearMS/">Department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The EECS minor, offered through the College of Engineering, is an optional program for students interested in coherent EECS study outside of their major. It is open to any undergraduate who has declared a major other than EECS and has completed four of the course requirements. For further information regarding the requirements and declaration process, please see the Minor Requirements tab.</p>
<p>The EECS Department also offers a minor in computer science. For information regarding this program, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/computer-science/">computer science program page in this Guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Joint Majors</h3>
<p>The EECS Department also offers two joint majors with other departments in the College of Engineering. For further information on these programs, please click the links below:<br/>

				<a name="fiveyearbsmstext"></a><h2>Five-Year BS/MS</h2><p><span>The Five-Year Bachelor/Master Program, called the 5th Year MS Program for short, offers qualified EECS and L&amp;S Computer Science undergraduate students a unique opportunity to begin graduate study during their undergraduate years, thereby accelerating the master's degree by requiring only one additional year beyond the bachelor's degree. This is not a concurrent degree program. Students earn their bachelor's degree first and then the master's. However, careful planning during the undergraduate program allows motivated students to begin a research project and complete some master's course requirements while still in undergraduate standing. Depending on how quickly a student progresses through the undergraduate program, the additional graduate year may come sooner than the fifth year at Berkeley. The five-year program is not intended for those who wish to pursue a PhD. For further information regarding this program, please see the </span><a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/FiveYearMS/" target="_blank">Department's website</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well. It is not intended for students who have definitely decided to pursue a PhD immediately following graduation. Those students are advised to apply for a PhD program at Berkeley or elsewhere during their senior year. Students who have been accepted into the five-year BA/MS or BS/MS are free to change their minds later and apply to enter the PhD program or apply to a PhD program at another university. Note that admission is competitive with all our PhD applicants.</p>
<p>The program is focused on interdisciplinary training at a graduate level; with at least 8 units of course work outside EECS required. Students will emerge as leaders in their technical and professional fields.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Focused on interdisciplinary study and more experience in aligned technical fields such as physics, materials science, statistics, biology, etc., and/or professional disciplines such as management of technology, business, law and public policy.</li>
	<li>If admitted to the program, students must begin the graduate portion in the semester immediately following the conferral of the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only one additional year (two semesters) is permitted beyond the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only available to Berkeley EECS and L&amp;S CS undergraduates.</li>
	<li>Participants in program may serve as graduate student instructors with approval from their faculty research advisor and the 5th Year MS Committee.</li>
	<li>Participants in program are self-funded.</li>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. Colleges typically do not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>Students do not need to be in the College of Engineering to pursue the EECS minor. </p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>​All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed with a letter grade.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required to apply for the minor.  </span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>L&amp;S Computer Science majors are discouraged from pursuing the EECS minor due to </span>redundancy<span> in </span>curriculum<span>. They may only use EE or EECS upper division courses towards the EECS minor and may not overlap any upper division courses between their major and minor.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>Student must submit the<a href="https://berkeley.app.box.com/s/cxr67xfrprany6z9k8577bbakk0rum1w" target="_blank"> Minor Declaration Form</a> once they have four or more of the minor requirements completed, and at least one semester prior to graduation.</li>
	<li>
	<p>All students must submit the <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/media-inline/fillable_eecs_minor_completion_form_2017.pdf" target="_blank">EECS Minor Completion Form</a>, signed by their Major or ESS Advisor, during their final semester.</p>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> C8R also includes quantitative reasoning concepts that aren’t covered in Data 8. These include certain topics in: principles of data visualization; simulation of random processes; and understanding numerical functions through their graphs. This will help prepare students for computational and quantitative courses other than Data 8.<br/>C8R takes advantage of the complementarity of computing and quantitative reasoning to enliven abstract ideas and build students’ confidence in their ability to solve real problems with quantitative tools. Students learn computer science concepts and immediately apply them to plot functions, visualize data, and simulate random events.<br/>
<br/>Foundations of Data Science (CS/Info/Stat C8, a.k.a. Data 8) is an increasingly popular class for entering students at Berkeley. Data 8 builds students’ computing skills in the first month of the semester, and students rely on these skills as the course progresses. For some students, particularly those with little prior exposure to computing, developing these skills benefits from further time and practice. C8R is a rapid introduction to Python programming, visualization, and data analysis, which will prepare students for success in Data 8.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will be able to perform basic computations in Python, including working with tabular data.<br/>
Students will be able to understand basic probabilistic simulations.<br/>
Students will be able to understand the syntactic structure of Python code.<br/>
Students will be able to use good practices in Python programming.<br/>
Students will be able to use visualizations to understand univariate data and to identify associations or causal relationships in bivariate data.</p></div>

Cryptography or cryptology is the science of designing algorithms and protocols for enabling parties to communicate and compute securely in an untrusted environment (e.g. secure communication, digital signature, etc.) Over the last four decades, cryptography has transformed from an ad hoc collection of mysterious tricks into a rigorous science based on firm complexity-theoretic foundations. This modern complexity-theoretic</span><span class="deschide"> approach to cryptography will be the focus. E.g., in the context of encryption we will begin by giving a precise mathematical definition for what it means to be a secure encryption scheme and then give a construction (realizing this security notion) assuming various computational hardness assumptions (e.g. factoring).</span><br/>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis</span><span class="deschide">, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br/>

The CS150 lectures in the Fall 2014 already covered the necessary lecture material, so students who took the CS150 lab in the Fall of 2014 will have a chance to expand their skills into the area of Application-Specific Integrated Circuit design.<br/>
Hence the pre-requisite for this course is that a student has taken the CS150 course in the Fall 2014.<br/></p></div>

				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Berkeley electrical engineering and computer sciences major (EECS), offered through the College of Engineering, combines fundamentals of computer science and electrical engineering in one major.</p>
<p>Note that students wishing to study<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Programs/two_ways.html"> computer science</a> at UC Berkeley have two different major options: The EECS major leads to the Bachelor of Science (BS), while the the College of Letters &amp; Sciences offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree.  An essential difference between the two majors is that the EECS program requires a greater number of math and science courses than the CS program, which requires a greater number of non-technical, or breadth, courses. For further information on the BA program, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/computer-science/">Computer Science program page in this Guide</a>. </p>
<p>After completing the required lower division courses, students in the EECS major are able to pursue coursework in computer science and/or electrical engineering based on their personal interests. As they approach graduation, students will be asked to select from one of two programs: electrical and computer engineering (ECE) or computer science and engineering (CSE), depending on their chosen area of concentration. This option is indicated on the student's transcript once their degree is conferred. </p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>All UC Berkeley programs are accredited through the Accrediting Commission for Schools, Western Association of Schools and Colleges (ACS WASC).</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>The EECS honors degree program is designed to provide very talented undergraduate students a greater connection to the department. Honors students pursue undergraduate research and select an academic concentration outside of EECS. In addition, students receive a special faculty adviser, engage in research, receive official notation of the honors degree on their Berkeley transcript, and are invited to special events with faculty and EECS honors alumni.</p>
<p>For more information regarding this program, please click<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/education/degrees.shtml#honors"> here.</a></p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering apply to a specific major within the college. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Change of College applications are not accepted for matriculated students in other colleges wishing to declare the EECS major. Prospective undergraduates interested in an EECS major must apply for admission to the College of Engineering.  </p>
<h3>Five-Year BS/MS Program</h3>
<p>The Five-Year Bachelor/Master Program, called the 5th Year MS Program for short, offers qualified EECS and L&amp;S Computer Science undergraduate students a unique opportunity to begin graduate study during their undergraduate years, thereby accelerating the master's degree by requiring only one additional year beyond the bachelor's degree. This is not a concurrent degree program. Students earn their bachelor's degree first and then the master's. However, careful planning during the undergraduate program allows motivated students to begin a research project and complete some master's course requirements while still in undergraduate standing. Depending on how quickly a student progresses through the undergraduate program, the additional graduate year may come sooner than the fifth year at Berkeley. The Five-Year Program is not intended for those who wish to pursue a PhD. For further information regarding this program, please see the Five-Year BS/MS tab on this page or the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/FiveYearMS/">Department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The EECS minor, offered through the College of Engineering, is an optional program for students interested in coherent EECS study outside of their major. It is open to any undergraduate who has declared a major other than EECS and has completed four of the course requirements. For further information regarding the requirements and declaration process, please see the Minor Requirements tab.</p>
<p>The EECS Department also offers a minor in computer science. For information regarding this program, please see the <a href="/undergraduate/degree-programs/computer-science/">computer science program page in this Guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Joint Majors</h3>
<p>The EECS Department also offers two joint majors with other departments in the College of Engineering. For further information on these programs, please click the links below:<br/>

				<a name="fiveyearbsmstext"></a><h2>Five-Year BS/MS</h2><p><span>The Five-Year Bachelor/Master Program, called the 5th Year MS Program for short, offers qualified EECS and L&amp;S Computer Science undergraduate students a unique opportunity to begin graduate study during their undergraduate years, thereby accelerating the master's degree by requiring only one additional year beyond the bachelor's degree. This is not a concurrent degree program. Students earn their bachelor's degree first and then the master's. However, careful planning during the undergraduate program allows motivated students to begin a research project and complete some master's course requirements while still in undergraduate standing. Depending on how quickly a student progresses through the undergraduate program, the additional graduate year may come sooner than the fifth year at Berkeley. The five-year program is not intended for those who wish to pursue a PhD. For further information regarding this program, please see the </span><a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/FiveYearMS/" target="_blank">Department's website</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>This program is geared toward students who would like to pursue an education beyond the BS/BA, allowing them to achieve greater breadth and/or depth of knowledge, and who would like to try their hand at research as well. It is not intended for students who have definitely decided to pursue a PhD immediately following graduation. Those students are advised to apply for a PhD program at Berkeley or elsewhere during their senior year. Students who have been accepted into the five-year BA/MS or BS/MS are free to change their minds later and apply to enter the PhD program or apply to a PhD program at another university. Note that admission is competitive with all our PhD applicants.</p>
<p>The program is focused on interdisciplinary training at a graduate level; with at least 8 units of course work outside EECS required. Students will emerge as leaders in their technical and professional fields.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Focused on interdisciplinary study and more experience in aligned technical fields such as physics, materials science, statistics, biology, etc., and/or professional disciplines such as management of technology, business, law and public policy.</li>
	<li>If admitted to the program, students must begin the graduate portion in the semester immediately following the conferral of the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only one additional year (two semesters) is permitted beyond the bachelor's degree.</li>
	<li>Only available to Berkeley EECS and L&amp;S CS undergraduates.</li>
	<li>Participants in program may serve as graduate student instructors with approval from their faculty research advisor and the 5th Year MS Committee.</li>
	<li>Participants in program are self-funded.</li>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. Colleges typically do not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>Students do not need to be in the College of Engineering to pursue the EECS minor. </p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>​All minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed with a letter grade.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required to apply for the minor.  </span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>L&amp;S Computer Science majors are discouraged from pursuing the EECS minor due to </span>redundancy<span> in </span>curriculum<span>. They may only use EE or EECS upper division courses towards the EECS minor and may not overlap any upper division courses between their major and minor.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>Student must submit the<a href="https://berkeley.app.box.com/s/cxr67xfrprany6z9k8577bbakk0rum1w" target="_blank"> Minor Declaration Form</a> once they have four or more of the minor requirements completed, and at least one semester prior to graduation.</li>
	<li>
	<p>All students must submit the <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/media-inline/fillable_eecs_minor_completion_form_2017.pdf" target="_blank">EECS Minor Completion Form</a>, signed by their Major or ESS Advisor, during their final semester.</p>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives &amp; Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> C8R also includes quantitative reasoning concepts that aren’t covered in Data 8. These include certain topics in: principles of data visualization; simulation of random processes; and understanding numerical functions through their graphs. This will help prepare students for computational and quantitative courses other than Data 8.<br/>C8R takes advantage of the complementarity of computing and quantitative reasoning to enliven abstract ideas and build students’ confidence in their ability to solve real problems with quantitative tools. Students learn computer science concepts and immediately apply them to plot functions, visualize data, and simulate random events.<br/>
<br/>Foundations of Data Science (CS/Info/Stat C8, a.k.a. Data 8) is an increasingly popular class for entering students at Berkeley. Data 8 builds students’ computing skills in the first month of the semester, and students rely on these skills as the course progresses. For some students, particularly those with little prior exposure to computing, developing these skills benefits from further time and practice. C8R is a rapid introduction to Python programming, visualization, and data analysis, which will prepare students for success in Data 8.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will be able to perform basic computations in Python, including working with tabular data.<br/>
Students will be able to understand basic probabilistic simulations.<br/>
Students will be able to understand the syntactic structure of Python code.<br/>
Students will be able to use good practices in Python programming.<br/>
Students will be able to use visualizations to understand univariate data and to identify associations or causal relationships in bivariate data.</p></div>

Cryptography or cryptology is the science of designing algorithms and protocols for enabling parties to communicate and compute securely in an untrusted environment (e.g. secure communication, digital signature, etc.) Over the last four decades, cryptography has transformed from an ad hoc collection of mysterious tricks into a rigorous science based on firm complexity-theoretic foundations. This modern complexity-theoretic</span><span class="deschide"> approach to cryptography will be the focus. E.g., in the context of encryption we will begin by giving a precise mathematical definition for what it means to be a secure encryption scheme and then give a construction (realizing this security notion) assuming various computational hardness assumptions (e.g. factoring).</span><br/>

This is a lab course that covers the design of modern Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The labs lay the foundation of modern digital design by first setting-up the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. Software testing of digital designs is covered leading into a set of labs that cover the design flow. Digital synthesis</span><span class="deschide">, floorplanning, placement and routing are covered, as well as tools to evaluate design timing and power. Chip-level assembly is covered, instantiation of custom IP blocks: I/O pads, memories, PLLs, etc. The labs culminate with a project design – implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with register file and caches.</span><br/>

The CS150 lectures in the Fall 2014 already covered the necessary lecture material, so students who took the CS150 lab in the Fall of 2014 will have a chance to expand their skills into the area of Application-Specific Integrated Circuit design.<br/>
Hence the pre-requisite for this course is that a student has taken the CS150 course in the Fall 2014.<br/></p></div>
